1. At the entrance to an industrial estate, there is a St. Andrew's Cross with the supplementary sign "Industrial estate, rail vehicles 
have precedence".
What must you remember?  
❌ Motor vehicles have precedence at level crossings without St. Andrew's Cross  
✅ Rail vehicles have precedence at all level crossings  
✅ Approach level crossings at moderate speed only  
**Comment**:  Approach level crossings at moderate speed only. Keep a close eye on what is happening. The additional sign “Industrial area, rail vehicles have priority” means that rail vehicles have priority at all level 
crossings within this industrial area.

2. You want to leave the motorway at the next exit. What is the correct course of action in this situation?
![Image1](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_2_18_022_ende.jpg)
✅ I turn on my right-side indicators now  
✅ I observe the traffic behind me  
❌ I begin now to smoothly brake down to 60 km/h  
**Comment**: If I want to leave the highway, the 300 m beacon is a good orientation for setting the blinker here. The best way to avoid unpleasant surprises is to keep an eye on the vehicles behind me (mirrors, shoulder) 
before leaving the highway. I may only slow down to pull out on the merging lane, i.e. when I have already left the highway. Braking on the highway is only necessary in traffic jams or at speed limits.  

3. What is true about using the hard shoulder in this situation?
![Image2](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_07_012.jpg)
The hard shoulder  
❌ may only be used by trucks  
✅ must be used like a right-hand lane  
❌ may only be used in a breakdown situation  
**Comment**: The blue sign indicates that the hard shoulder is free as the right-hand lane. The matrix signs show the maximum permitted  speed. If the lane is free, I must follow the right-hand traffic regulations and use 
the hard shoulder as a right-hand lane until the regulation is lifted again by another sign.  

4. Where do you have to anticipate encountering rail crossings with no technical safeguards?  
✅ On less-frequently used roads  
✅ In industrial zones and port areas  
✅ On dirt tracks and forest tracks  

5. What do hazard warning lights draw your attention to?  
✅ To school buses with children boarding or alighting  
✅ To vehicles which have broken down  
✅ To a traffic congestion  
**Comment**: Hazard warning lights warn follo wing vehicles of various dangers. It indicates obstacles on the road, e.g. a broken-down vehicle or a traffic jam. School buses from which children are getting on and off also 
use them, as children sometimes cross the road carelessly.  

6. What must a motor vehicle's maximum speed, determined by its construction, be at least if you want to use this road?
![Image3](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_116.jpg)  
✅ 61 km/h  
❌ 51 km/h  
❌ 81 km/h  
**Comment**: The StVO stipulates that motorways may only be used by vehicles with a maximum design speed of more than 60km/h i.e. at least 61km/h. 

7. Driving on a very busy road with several lanes, you have manoeuvred yourself into the lane for taking a left turn. 
Now instead of turning left, you want to turn right. What should you do?    
❌ I reverse with my hazard lights turned on  
✅ I turn left  
❌ Driving a wide curve, I turn right  
**Comment**: If you have taken the wrong lane on a road with a high volume of traffic, you may only continue driving in the lane you have taken. A sudden change of direction in heavy traffic would be too dangerous for you 
and other road users. You must therefore turn left here and take a detour.

8. You are driving along a forest track and approach a level crossing without St. Andrew's Cross. What do you do?  
✅ Listen out in case a rail vehicle signals its approach by whistling or ringing a bell  
❌ Proceed without taking any special precautions since rail vehicles are required to wait here  
✅ Proceed at moderate speed and check to see if a rail vehicle is approaching  
**Comment**: Approach level crossings at a moderate speed only. Keep a close eye on what is happening. On field and forest paths, you must also listen for the sound of a rail vehicle whistling or ringing.  

9.  What must you be aware of when using navigation systems and road maps?  
❌ All navigation systems can update themselves automatically  
✅ Even up-to-date contents may differ from reality  
✅ The contents may become outdated just a short time after purchase  

10. What is especially important when choosing the speed for driving along tree-lined avenues with narrow roadways? ---- IMP  
✅ It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction  
❌ Rapidly changing light conditions make it easier to estimate lateral distances  
✅ To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously  
**Comment**: The alternation of light and shade typical of avenues restricts visibility: It is difficult to judge distances and side distances, e.g. to the trees and to oncoming traffic. On narrow roads, you should 
therefore only drive fast enough to stop within half your visibility.  

11. The barrier of a level crossing inside a built-up area is closed. Where must you wait?  
❌ Before the first beacon  
❌ Before the last beacon  
✅ In front of the St. Andrew's Cross  
**Comment**: Approach level crossings at moderate speed only. You must wait in front of the St. Andrew's cross when the barriers are closed.  

12. What do you have to be aware of when you see this traffic sign combination?  
![Image4](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_135.jpg)  
❌ A rail crossing at a distance of 120 m  
✅ A rail crossing at a distance of 240 m  
✅ No overtaking of vehicles permitted  
**Comment**: The “level crossing” danger sign in combination with the 3-lane beacon indicates a level crossing about 240 m away (2-lane = 160 m, 1-lane = 80 m). Overtaking is also prohibited up to the level crossing!  

13. What is true in relation to yellow road markings?  
Yellow road markings  
❌ only apply to construction site traffic  
✅ replace the validity of white road markings  
✅ are only applied temporarily (at construction sites for example)   
**Comment**: Yellow markings on the road temporarily cancel the validity of white markings: the yellow markings, e.g. at roadworks, take precedence.  

14. You are driving at the recommended speed on the motorway and want to leave it at the next exit. What should you do?  ----IMP  
✅ I cease overtaking manoeuvres in good time.  
❌ I significantly reduce my speed while still on the right-hand lane of the motorway  
✅ I significantly reduce my speed on the exit lane  
**Comment**: It is easy to drive too fast when leaving the highway. Stop overtaking early and reduce your speed on the exit lane and not on the motorway lane, as you are already at the recommended speed (look at your  
speedometer!) so that you do not have to brake on the exit bend.  

15. Who is required to stop at a level crossing with a red flashing light in the form of an arrow point to the right?  
✅ Traffic turning right  
❌ Traffic moving straight ahead  
❌ Traffic turning left  
**Comment**: A St. Andrew's cross with a red flashing light in the form of an arrow pointing to the right is only important for drivers turning right. It is meaningless for drivers going straight ahead. If the system is 
flashing, drivers turning right must wait.  

16. You are driving on a road outside a built-up area with three lanes marked in each direction. Individual slower vehicles are  
travelling well spaced out in the right-hand lane. Which lane may you use continuously?  
✅ The middle lane  
❌ The left-hand lane  
**Comment**:  Outside built-up areas, you may use the middle lane continuously in this case if a vehicle stops or slows down on the right-hand lane, even if only occasionally  
  
17. What must you do if you find yourself in a traffic jam on motorways and on highways with two lanes travelling in the same direction?  
I have to  
❌ drive as far to the left as possible in the right-hand lane  
✅ drive as far to the left as possible in the left-hand lane  
✅ drive as far to the right as possible in the right-hand lane  
**Comment**:  In the event of gridlocked traffic or traffic jams on highways and motorways, a clear lane must be formed for emergency vehicles. The vehicles in the leftmost lane should drive as far to the left as possible, 
all others as far to the right as possible in their lanes.  
  
18. What should you anticipate when driving at high speed on the motorway?  
✅ Other road users underestimating my speed  
✅ I might not respond to hazards in good enough time  
✅ Cross winds can negatively affect my stability on the road  
  
19. What does this traffic sign mean? ![Image5](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_142.jpg)  
❌ You are only allowed to drive at walking speed  
❌ You must indicate when entering the roundabout  
✅ Stopping on the roundabout is forbidden  
**Comment**:  In a traffic circle marked in this way, the vehicles in the circle have right of way. It is not permitted to stop in a traffic circle.  
  
20. What vehicles may enter a cycle highway that has this sign? ![Image6](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_018.jpg)  
❌ All mopeds with a maximum design speed less than 25 km/h  
✅ All vehicles driven by residents  
❌ All cars, provided they travel at walking speed  
**Comment**:  No other vehicle traffic is permitted in cycle lanes. The additional sign permits an exception here: residents may drive their vehicles onto these roads -but only at a maximum speed of 30 km/h.  
  
21.  You are driving on a section of road where a traffic jam has been reported. What is the right course of action?(repeat)  
✅ I take particular care when driving around bends and on the approach to summits  
❌ I apply the emergency brake assist to safely stop before the tail end of the traffic jam  
✅ I continue to follow the traffic reports  
**Comment**:  The traffic radio provides regular information about the traffic situation. If I leave it switched on, I can find out in good time whether a traffic jam is forming or breaking up ahead of me, for example. If 
there are traffic jam warnings, I have to be particularly attentive and careful when driving on blind roads such as bends or crests(approach to summits). Emergency Brake Assist is a system for emergencies, not for safe 
driving maneuvers.  
  
22. Why should you further reduce your speed here?  
✅ Because other people may walk onto the road  
✅ Because the red car could cross onto my lane  
❌ Because the blue car could continue moving  
**Comment**:  Broken-down vehicles are obstacles that you have to avoid. The broken-down vehicle forces other vehicles in oncoming traffic into my lane: reduce speed! You must also be aware of other people who could get
out of the broken-down vehicle. A person in front of the broken-down vehicle shows me that it will not continue for the time being. TIP: Watch the movie again and watch out for movement in oncoming traffic!  
 
23. One of your tyres bursts while you are travelling at high speed on an autobahn. What do you do?  
✅ Stop, if possible, on the hard shoulder, switch on hazard warning lights and place the warning triangle  
✅ Throttle down, if necessary, steer against and brake cautiously  
❌ Immediately apply the brakes fully and move over onto the hard shoulder  
**Comment**: If a tire blows out on your car, you should first take your foot off the accelerator and brake carefully if necessary. If your vehicle pulls to one side, you must counter-steer. Try to stop on the hard 
shoulder. Secure the danger zone by switching on the hazard warning lights and setting up the warning triangle.  

24. As a resident, you want to drive into a cycle highway that has this sign. What must you be aware of when doing so?  
![Image7](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_168.jpg)  
✅ Cycles may travel alongside one another  
✅ Cycle traffic may not be impeded  
✅ Vehicles may not be driven faster than 30 km/h  
**Comment**:  No other vehicle traffic is permitted in cycle lanes. Bicycles must not be obstructed and must ride side by side. The additional sign allows an exception here: residents may enter these roads with their 
vehicles -but only at a maximum speed of 30 km/h.  
  
25. When must you wait at a level crossing?  
✅ When a flashing red light comes on  
✅ When the barriers are being lowered  
✅ When a railway employee is waving a white-red-white flag  
**Comment**:  Only approach level crossings at a moderate speed so that you can stop if necessary. You must wait in front of a level crossing when the red flashing light is on, the barriers are lowered or a railroad 
employee is waving a white-red-white flag.
  
26. When are you allowed to remain on the left-hand lane in this situation?  
![Image8](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_6_06_213.jpg)   
If my vehicle  
❌ is 2 m wide according to the registration certificate part I (Motor Vehicle Registration)  
✅ including the load actually has a maximum width of 2 m  
**Comment**:  The sign indicates a lane narrowing. Only vehicles with an actual width of 2 m may use the left-hand lane. This applies including load and wing mirrors. It should also be noted that the vehicle width is 
stated in the vehicle documents without wing mirrors. If my vehicle is too wide, I must change to the right-hand lane in good time.  
  
27. What does this traffic sign combination indicate?  
![Image9](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_2_19_113.jpg)  
A rail crossing  
✅ which I may cross at a maximum speed of 10 km/h  
✅ which I may approach at a maximum speed of 10 km/h  
❌ over which rail traffic may pass at a maximum speed of 10 km/h    
**Comment**: The danger sign “level crossing” in combination with the speed limit “10” only permits a maximum speed of 10 km/h up to the level crossing. This also applies when crossing the level crossing.  
  
28. You want to use an autobahn. To allow you to do so, what type-specific maximum speed must be entered in Part I of the  
registration certificate or in the operating licence?    
Answer: More than __60__ km/h  
**Comment**: Freeways and motorways are used to make rapid progress. For this reason, only vehicles with a maximum speed of more than 60 km/h specified in the vehicle documents or operating license are permitted to drive 
on them.  
  
29. Why should you have the traffic information switched on, when driving on the motorway?  
Because the traffic information  
✅ gives warnings about motorists heading in the wrong direction  
✅ provides reports about traffic jams  
❌ is a prescribed requirement for travelling on the motorway  
**Comment**:  Something can always happen on the highway. I make sure I'm informed in good time about accidents, traffic jams, wrong-way drivers or obstructions by switching on the traffic radio.  
  
30. What must you do when a traffic jam forms on this road?   
![Image10](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_18_015_1.jpg)  
Remaining within my lane, I  
❌ drive as far to the right as possible  
❌ continuing driving in the centre  
✅ drive as far to the left as possible  
**Comment**:  As soon as traffic comes to a standstill or a traffic jam occurs, space must be created for emergency vehicles (e.g. police and ambulances), the so-called “rescue lane”: vehicles in the left-hand lane drive 
as far to the left as possible, all others as far to the right as possible.  
  
31. A traffic jam is building up here. What is the correct procedure?  
![Imag11](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_08_008.jpg)  
✅ If possible, switch on hazard warning lights to warn vehicles following behind  
✅ Drive as far as possible to the right in order to leave room for a channel on the left  
❌ Drive as far as possible to the left in order to leave room for a channel on the right  
**Comment**: To make following road users aware of the traffic jam, hazard warning lights should be switched on. In the event of a traffic jam, space must always be created for emergency vehicles. On roads with three 
lanes for one direction, a clear lane must therefore be formed between the left and middle lanes. If you are driving in the middle lane, you must drive as far to the right as possible so that there is room for the lane on 
the left. 
  
32. What is true in this situation about using the hard shoulder?  
![Image12](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_07_013.jpg)  
The hard shoulder  
✅ may only be used in the case of a breakdown  
❌ must be used in the same way as a right-hand lane  
❌ may only be used by trucks  
**Comment**:  There are two traffic signs that prohibit the use of the hard shoulder as a traffic lane: The blue sign with the red line means “no longer use the hard shoulder” and the red crossed oblique bars above the 
roadway (keyword “permanent light sign”) completely block the lane below. This removes or ends the previously permitted use of the hard shoulder as a lane.  
  
33. What should you do if you see a vehicle with its hazard lights on?  
✅ I reduce my speed  
✅ I ready myself for hazards occurring suddenly  
❌ I continue driving just as before  
**Comment**: If I see hazard warning lights, I must expect a traffic obstruction and sudden danger. This could be a school bus from which children are getting off, a car that is being towed away or a truck that has broken 
down.

34. What is the maximum speed you are allowed to drive a car on roads with one marked lane for each direction outside built-up areas?  
The speed limit for cars outside built-up areas on roads with one lane in each direction is ___100___ km/h.  
  
35. What is the right course of action now?  
![Image13](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_2_18_016_ende.jpg)  
✅ I warn the driver by sounding my horn and flashing my lights  
✅ I drive over to the right-side as far as possible  
✅ I notify the police  
**Comment**: If a wrong-way driver approaches me on the highway exit, I can try to warn him with the horn (sound) or flashing lights. For my own safety, I drive on the far right. If the other driver does not react, I 
report the wrong-way driver to the police.  
  
36.  What does this traffic sign mean?  
![Imag14](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_2_19_109.jpg)  
✅ Indication of existing overhead electrical wires  
✅ You must always wait when a rail vehicle is approaching  
✅ Rail traffic always has priority  
**Comment**:  The St. Andrew's cross is usually located directly in front of level crossings and indicates that rail traffic must be given priority. A flashing arrow in the middle of the St. Andrew's cross indicates that 
the railroad line has an overhead electric line.  
  
37. When driving on motorways, why should you maintain the recommended speed of 130 km/h?  
Because this  
✅ can prevent accidents occurring  
✅ can reduce the severity of possible accidents  
✅ achieves an even flow of traffic  
**Comment**:  The speed limit on German highways is based on experience in other countries. If as many people as possible observe the speed limit, the risk of accidents, or at least the risk of serious accidents, will be 
reduced. In addition, an even flow of traffic could be achieved. However, this is a recommendation, not a prescribed maximum speed (speed limit).  
  
38.  What do you have to be aware of in this situation?  
![Image14](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_04_005.jpg)  
Due to the constant changing of light and shadow  
❌ I am more easily able to judge distances  
✅ I have to drive with particular care  
✅ I may be poorly visible to other road users  
**Comment**:  The alternating light and shade typical of avenues makes it difficult to see here: distances are not easier, but rather more difficult to judge. I myself am also less visible to others than usual. I should 
therefore adapt my speed to the visibility conditions and drive particularly carefully.  
  
39. Horse riders sign in blue traffic sign means -  
❌ A path, which may not be used by riders  
✅ A bridle-path, which riders are required to use  
✅ A bridle-path, which may not be used by other road users  
**Comment**:  The sign means: Riders must use this path with their horses! Use is prohibited for all other road users.  
  
40. What does this traffic sign indicate?  
![Image15](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_42_006.jpg)  
❌ Federal road (Bundesstrasse) 22  
✅ A diversion for autobahn traffic when required  
❌ An underground station  
**Comment**: This traffic sign indicates an emergency detour for highway traffic. If you follow this traffic sign with the same number during a traffic jam, for example, you will be redirected back to the highway at a 
later point.  

41. If you have to take left turn and there are two routes possible, Which one you will take?  
❌ Both  
✅ Right  
❌ Left  
**Comment**: This is a “normal” road without one-way traffic, i.e. traffic is permitted in both directions. I must keep to the right-hand lane to avoid endangering oncoming traffic: I keep to the right-hand lane here!  
  
42. What emotions can influence driving behaviour?  
✅ Happiness and exuberance  
✅ Anger and rage  
✅ Worry and sorrow  
**Comment**: When driving, you should concentrate exclusively on the traffic. Strong emotions such as anger and rage, but also great joy or lively conversations also require attention - and have a negative impact on 
driving behavior.
  
43. How can your fitness to drive be quickly restored following the excessive consumption of alcohol?  
❌ By drinking two cups of coffee  
✅ Nothing can achieve this  
❌ By doing 15 minutes of sport  
**Comment**: An intoxicated driver cannot restore his or her ability to drive in the short term. The performance of the liver, which breaks down alcohol, can be accelerated by NOTHING. At best, it can break down approx. 
0.1 per mille per hour.  
  
44. What indications mean you should interrupt your journey?  
✅ Yawning frequently  
✅ Difficulties staying in lane  
✅ Difficulty keeping your eyes open  
**Comment**:  An intoxicated driver cannot restore his or her ability to drive in the short term. The performance of the liver, which breaks down alcohol, can be accelerated by NOTHING. At best, it can break down approx. 
0.1 per mille per hour.  
  
45. How can the consumption of cannabis products affect the driver?  
✅ It reduces the awareness of other traffic  
❌ It reduces sensitivity to glare  
✅ It reduces the ability to concentrate on driving  
**Comment**:  The example of cannabis shows that drug use can have dangerous effects: After smoking a joint, there can be severe disturbances in attention and concentration.  
  
46. What are the possible effects of hashish consumption?  
✅ Diminished awareness of danger  
✅ Increased likelihood of mistakes in assimilating information  
✅ Misjudgement of speed and distance  
  
47. What are the possible effects of hashish consumption?  
❌ Improved judgement of time  
✅ Intoxication with dangerous hallucination and reduced reaction capability  
✅ Intoxication with confusion and depression  
  
48. What can happen if you ignore signs of tiredness?  
✅ Driving mistakes  
✅ Lack of concentration  
✅ Microsleep  
  
49. What is the right thing to do if you sense signs of fatigue during a night-time journey?  
✅ I interrupt the journey to take an adequate break  
❌ I decide against taking a break, and fight the tiredness  
✅ I allow a co-driver to drive, if possible  
  
50. You receive a telephone call while driving. What must you be aware of?  
I may use the telephone if  
✅ using the telephone only requires a momentary glance  
❌ the telephone is not used for longer than 7 seconds here  
✅ the telephone in not held in my hand for this purpose  
**Comment**: Cell phones (cell phones) must not be picked up or held by the driver while driving. Only a hands-free device allows you to make calls while driving. In addition, the driver may only look away from the traffic 
for a very short time at most when operating and using the phone.  
  
51. You want to make a telephone call while driving. What must you be aware of?  
✅ I may use the telephone without a hands-free unit, if the vehicle is parked in a suitable place, and the engine is fully switched off  
✅ I need to have a hands-free unit  
❌ I may use the telephone without a hands-free, if the vehicle is moving at walking pace  
  
52. How long does cannabis and its degradation products remain detectable in urine?  
❌ Several days at most  
❌ Only for a few hours  
✅ For some weeks  
  
53.  Who is not allowed to drink alcohol when driving motor vehicles?  
✅ All drivers under 21  
❌ All drivers  
✅ All drivers during their probation period  
**Comment**: Drivers under the influence of alcohol are a danger to themselves and others. This is especially true for young drivers under the age of 21 and for novice drivers who are not yet familiar with driving. 
Therefore: zero alcohol.  
  
56.  Which is the stamp of a responsible driver?  
❌ He is assertive towards other road traffic  
✅ He avoids driving when tired  
✅ He anticipates the mistakes of other road users  
**Comment**: Responsible drivers adapt to the traffic situation as partners, show consideration and take into account the mistakes of others. Self-observation is also part of this, so that “risky driving” is avoided as far 
as possible when tired or angry.  
  
57. What can impair fitness to drive?  
✅ Certain medicines  
✅ Alcohol and other intoxicants  
✅ Fatigue  
  
58. What can result from listening to very loud music while driving a car?  
✅ It causes a nuisance to other road users  
✅ The driver fails to detect signals from other traffic  
❌ The driver’s responsiveness is enhanced  
  
59. Why can fitness to drive be impaired even by just a small quantity of alcohol?  
✅ Because this reduces the field of vision  
✅ Because this diminishes spatial vision  
❌ Because this reduces the reaction time  
**Comment**: Even small amounts of alcohol are known to impair driving ability. This applies to spatial vision, for example. But it also reduces your field of vision. If you still want to drive, you should therefore not 
drink a drop.  
  
60. Why is an individual unfit to drive after consuming the drug crystal meth?  
✅ Because of the possible sudden onset of fatigue  
✅ Because it is possible to over-estimate personal capabilities  
✅ Because of the possibility of experiencing hallucinations  
  
61. How can fatigue be prevented on a long journey?  
❌ Drink coffee and make no stops  
✅ By well-timed and sufficient stops for rests  
✅ Gymnastic exercises during stops  
  
62. What should you do if you start feeling tired while driving?  
❌ Listen to stimulating music  
✅ Get out of the car and move around in the fresh air  
✅ Take a break straightaway  
**Comment**: Microsleep means danger to life. Even at the first signs of tiredness, don't fool yourself! Take a break as soon as possible, get some fresh air and exercise or loosen up.  
  
63. What are the effects of listening to loud music - especially with an extremely loud bass volume - in the car?  
✅ Blind people lose their orientation when they are near the car  
✅ The driver’s attention is significantly impaired  
❌ It makes it easier for blind people to recognise where the road is  
**Comment**: Visually impaired and blind people are particularly dependent on their hearing. Special consideration is required here. Very loud and bass-heavy music can restrict these people in their orientation. It can 
also distract the driver.  

64. What effects can result from taking drugs?  
✅ A miscalculation of speeds  
✅ Increased readiness to take risks  
✅ Impairment of concentration  
**Comment**: Drug use and road traffic do not go together: The substances impair concentration, speeds are misjudged - and the willingness to take risks can increase dangerously.  
  
65. What can affect ability to drive in a similar way to alcohol?  
✅ Medications  
❌ Soft drinks  
✅ Drugs  
**Comment**: Some drugs (see package insert) and all intoxicating substances impair driving ability at least as much as alcohol. Caution!  
  
66. What is the risk if you become distracted while using electronic devices when driving?  
❌ My stopping distance may be reduced  
✅ I may fail to notice road traffic signs  
✅ I may deviate from my lane  
**Comment**: The use of electronic devices while driving increases the risk of accidents, as their operation can distract the driver. For this reason, an electronic device used for communication, information or 
organization may not be picked up and held in the hand while driving. Only voice control or briefly looking away from the traffic situation, adapted to the circumstances, is permitted.  
  
67. The red car in front of you has been driving slowly for some time now. What is the correct course of action in    
this situation?   
![Image16](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_1_11_014_ende.jpg)  
❌ I close the distance and sound my horn  
✅ I maintain my speed  
❌ I overtake, because the road is clear  
**Comment**:  If someone is driving slowly in front of me, I have to drive at a sufficient distance behind them until I can overtake safely - and stay calm (don't tailgate or honk!). On a left-hand bend, I see oncoming  
traffic too late. I can't overtake here yet.  
  
68. If someone overtakes me even though an oncoming vehicle is already very close, I drive on the extreme right. I slow down my vehicle carefully (rear-view mirror) and allow the overtaking vehicle to pull in.  
  
69. During the journey your passenger informs you that you are repeatedly tailgating. What should you do? Note: tailgaiting means "drive   
too closely behind (another vehicle)."  
❌ I ignore the passenger’s comments  
✅ I take the passenger’s comments seriously  
✅ I maintain a greater distance  
**Comment**: The impressions that other road users and especially passengers have of my driving style can provide a realistic driver's self-image. It is best to take their criticism seriously and pay attention to how they 
feel. If a greater distance reassures other drivers, no problem!  
  
70. The vehicle ahead has prevented you from overtaking for some time now. What is the right course of action?  
✅ I wait until I am able to overtake  
❌ I close the gap  
❌ I sound my horn and flash my headlights persistently  
**Comment**: Strong emotions such as anger and rage distract me from the traffic situation. I shouldn't let this control me. If I wait calmly until I can overtake, I will reach my destination more safely.  
  
71. You have narrowly avoided a road traffic accident through emergency braking. Your hands and knees are shaking. What is the right course of action?  
✅ Later, I ponder if I could have avoided the situation  
❌ I continue driving in order to calm myself  
✅ I take a break at the soonest possible opportunity, in order to calm myself  
**Comment**: Emergency braking causes strong emotional excitement, especially if I can narrowly avoid an accident. This affects my perception and concentration and can lead to driving errors. If my hands and knees are 
shaking, I should never just carry on driving. Instead, I take a break as soon as possible until I have calmed down again. Later, I can calmly think again about whether the situation could have been avoided.  
  
72. You are on a road outside of a built-up area, and a car in front of you is driving much slower than is permitted to and has  
the capacity to. What is the right course of action?  
❌ I flash my headlights, until the car begins to drive faster  
✅ I adjust my speed to that of the car  
✅ I overtake at a suitable place  
**Comment**: If someone is driving very slowly in front of me, getting upset won't help. Maybe he has a good reason for it. The best thing to do is to match your own speed to the vehicle in front. Keep a safe distance and 
only overtake when there is an opportunity to overtake safely.  
  
73. What emotions can influence driving behaviour?  
✅ Worry and sorrow  
✅ Anger and rage  
✅ Happiness and exuberance  
  
74. How can you recognise a good driver?  
A good driver  
✅ exhibits a calm and relaxed driving style  
❌ always informs other traffic participants of their driving errors  
✅ refrains from responding to provocations on the road  
**Comment**: Good drivers avoid dangerous situations and do not allow themselves to be provoked. They drive calmly and calmly and behave in a cooperative, not instructive manner.  
  
75.  Travelling on a main road after a lengthy period of time of following behind, you are finally able to overtake a very slow-moving car. What should you do?  
After overtaking  
❌ I brake briefly in order to call the attention of the other driver to his slow speed  
✅ I pull back in after an adequate distance in order not to impede the other driver  
❌ I drive especially slowly in order to emphasise to the other driver the effects of his driving style  
  
76. While driving, you become very annoyed at the behaviour of another road user. What is the right course of action now?  
✅ If necessary, I take a break to calm myself down  
✅ I continue to concentrate on the road traffic  
✅ I continue driving in such a way that my anger does not negatively affect road safety  
**Comment**: Strong feelings such as anger and rage impair perception and concentration. They can be distracting and lead to driving errors. It is therefore important to continue to concentrate on the traffic as much as 
possible. Anger must not be allowed to affect road safety. In the worst case, it is better to take a break and only continue driving when I have calmed down again.  
  
77. After overtaking you, a car pulls back into lane without leaving sufficient space in front of you. What should you do?  
❌ I flash my headlights in order to call attention to the impediment  
✅ I brake in order to ensure that the safety distance is again established  
✅ I remain calm in order to avoid conflicts  
**Comment**: There is no point in getting angry about the misconduct of others. Anger only impairs your own ability to drive. Stay calm, increase your (safety) distance and drive on unimpressed. Avoid so-called 
“instructions” such as flashing your headlights.  

78. Participation in road traffic requires caution at all times and consideration towards other road users. What does this mean for you? You must  
✅ drive with foresight  
❌ insist on your right of priority at all times  
✅ reckon with improper conduct on the part of others  
**Comment**: Being on the road requires constant caution and mutual consideration so that traffic is as safe as possible for everyone. You drive carefully if you drive with foresight and expect other road users to make 
mistakes.  

79. At which places where there are no traffic signs regulating priority does the rule "right before left" apply?  
✅ At crossroads and junctions  
❌ At the end of a traffic calmed area  
❌ At driveways  
❌ At junctions with sunken kerbstone  
❌ At junctions of farm tracks or forest tracks with other roads  
**Comment**: At junctions and crossroads, right of way is given to those coming from the right. This basic rule, in short “right before left”,applies at all crossroads and junctions without traffic signs. Field or forest 
paths are not considered roads and are therefore not taken into account when they meet a developed road.  
  
80. What is correct?  
![Image17](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_36_004.jpg)  
✅ I must get ready to proceed  
✅ The yellow car must leave the crossroads  
❌ I can turn now  
**Comment**: If a police officer is standing at the junction with his arm raised, this means that all road users at the junction should leave the junction quickly. All other road users must wait in front of the 
intersection for the next signal. The yellow car must clear the junction and you must prepare to continue your journey.    
  
81. What is correct?  
![Image18](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_36_005.jpg)  
✅ Wait at the crossroads  
❌ Turn without stopping  
**Comment**: If you see a police officer with his arms outstretched to the side in front or behind you at the junction, you must wait in front of the junction.  
  
82. What applies here?![Image19](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_36_101.jpg)  
❌ Turning off is prohibited  
❌ You must wait for further signals from the police officer before the crossroads may be entered  
✅ The crossroads may be crossed  
**Comment**: If you see a police officer in front of you at the intersection with his arms outstretched to the side, traffic is cleared for your direction of travel. You may cross the intersection.  
  
83. Even if the traffic light is green: I stay at the stop line as long as there is no further traffic after the intersection.  
Otherwise I'm blocking the junction! If I have to, I prefer to wait until the next green phase.  
  
84. What increases the risk of an accident?  
  Driving  
✅ with iced over side windows  
✅ with the sun low in the sky out front  
✅ with a misted up windscreen  
**Comment**:  All unfavorable conditions (e.g. due to winter weather) increase the risk of accidents: the low, dazzling sun as well as fogged or icy windows -all of which obstruct my view.  
  
85. What should you understand by defensive driving?  
❌ Stopping as a precaution at every crossroads  
✅ Allowing for other people's mistakes  
✅ Not insisting on your rights  
**Comment**: Adapt calmly to the traffic situation. Give up your right of way if you can avoid or defuse dangerous situations. Driving defensively means not insisting on your rights, showing consideration for others and 
expecting others to make mistakes.  
  
86. Who has priority here?  
![Image20](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_36_015.jpg)  
✅ The red car  
❌ Me  
❌ The motorbike  
**Comment**: Signs and instructions from police officers take precedence over all other regulations. This means that when a police officer regulates traffic, only his signs apply; he overrides traffic signs and traffic 
lights. In this case, he gives cross traffic the go-ahead, I have to wait. The car wants to go straight ahead and is allowed to go first because the motorcycle has to let it go first as it is turning left.  
  
87. What is the right thing to do?  
![Image21](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_060.jpg)  
✅ The yellow car has to wait  
✅ I have to indicate  
❌ I have to wait  
**Comment**: Even if it looks like a “real” traffic circle at first glance. The sign with the three circular arrows is missing here. Therefore,  the usual right of way rules apply here! The blue arrow sign means: turn 
right. In contrast to the traffic sign for traffic circles, I have to indicate when entering and leaving the traffic circle. Traffic in the circle does NOT have right of way here. For them,  the rule is: RIGHT BEFORE LEFT, 
so they have to wait and let me go first.  
  
88. Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. Oncoming traffic and I have “right of way” at this junction, cross traffic from the  
right and left must wait. As a left-turner, however, I must first allow the oncoming vehicle to pass before I turn.  
  
89. What do you do when you see this traffic sign?  
![Image21](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_001.jpg)  
❌ Observe the traffic coming from the right only  
✅ Be ready to brake  
✅ Reduce speed  
**Comment**: The Cross sign in a Red Triangle indicates a junction or intersection with right of way from the right. For you, this means: reduce speed, drive with increased attention and remain ready to brake so that you 
can give way if necessary.
  
90. Are you allowed to park here?
![Image22](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_110.jpg)
✅ Yes, as a person accompanying blind persons with an official parking permit
❌ Yes, briefly for shopping
✅ Yes, as a seriously disabled person with an official parking permit
**Comment**: P with disabled person means - The additional sign “Severely disabled persons with exceptional walking disabilities and blind persons” permits parking only with an official parking permit, e.g. for severely 
disabled persons and persons accompanying blind persons.  
  
91. What is the minimum distance you must leave clear when stopping or parking in front of a pedestrian crossing? __5__ m  
  
92. A person at the side of the road is wearing a yellow armband with three black spots. What does this armband indicate?  
❌ This person belongs to a particular profession  
✅ The wearer is disabled  
✅ I am obliged to behave in a particular way towards this person  
**Comment**:  Visually impaired and blind people are among the most vulnerable road users. Increased consideration is required here. Expect unusual behavior and drive with extreme caution.  
  
93. Where are you allowed to park on the left in the direction of travel?  
✅ Where there are rails on the right-hand side  
❌ Where parking is prohibited on the right  
✅ In one-way streets  
**Comment**:  Anyone who leaves their vehicle or stops for longer than 3 minutes must park. In one-way streets or if there are rails on the right-hand side, you may also park on the left.  
  
94. You are approaching a bus stop marked like this. What do you do if you see children there?
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_008.jpg) Sign 224-51  
❌ Speed must not be reduced when a bus stops at a stopping bay  
✅ Reduce your speed and be ready to brake+ää  
❌ A reduction in speed is only necessary when a school bus is stopping there  
**Comment**:  The signs mark a school bus stop. If you approach the bus stop and see children there, you must reduce your speed. Stay ready to slow down, e.g. because other children could run across the road to the bus 
stop.  

95. You want to turn out of a road with a sunken kerbstone into another road. A car is coming from the left. What applies here?  
✅ Whoever turns into a road over a sunken kerbstone must wait  
❌ The rule "right before left"  
❌ The sunken kerbstone is of no relevance for the obligation to wait  
**Comment**:  If you want to turn onto a road via a dropped kerb, all other road users have priority. Here you are obliged to wait for the car coming from the left: lowered kerbs are regarded in road traffic as property 
entrances (§ 10 StVO).  
  
96. Where must you particularly reckon with dirt on the roadway and therefore danger of skidding?  
❌ At innercity crossroads  
✅ At junctions with farm tracks  
✅ Near construction sites  
**Comment**:  In the area of roadworks and at the junctions of country lanes, you must expect heavy soiling of the road surface. Be prepared for an uneven and slippery road surface and adjust your speed accordingly.  
  
97. What applies according to this traffic sign?   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_140.jpg)
✅ I may only park on designated places  
✅ I have to drive at walking speed  
✅ I may not impede pedestrians  
**Comment**:  A traffic-calmed area begins here. Children's games are allowed everywhere, so I have to pay particular attention to children playing. Driving is only permitted at walking speed. Pedestrians go first: I have 
to wait if necessary. Parking is only permitted in marked areas.  
  
98. What must you do upon seeing this traffic sign?  
✅ I must approach at a moderate speed if it is clear that pedestrians want to cross the road  
✅ I must allow the pedestrians to cross the road  
✅ I may not remain stationary on the pedestrian crossing if the traffic backs up  
**Comment**: The sign is located directly at the “crosswalk”. Approach at a moderate speed and allow pedestrians to cross if necessary. For safety reasons, it is generally not permitted to overtake at crosswalks. If 
traffic is at a standstill, you must not come to a standstill on the crossing and block it for pedestrians: Wait in front of it.  
  
99. Ahead of the motorbike a car is seeking to reverse on the road. What should you anticipate?  
✅ That the car continues to reverse  
✅ That my braking distance will be longer than normal  
✅ That the motorbike will suddenly brake  
  
100. What does this traffic sign indicate?  
Pesdestrian walk sign board  
The start of a zone with  
✅ a permitted maximum speed of 30 km/h  
❌ a recommended speed of 30 km/h  
❌ an obligatory minimum speed of 30 km/h  
**Comment**: It is not permitted to drive faster than indicated within an area marked in this way. There is no signage for individual streets. The maximum permitted speed here is 30 km/h. Speeds below 30 km/h are also 
possible. The end of such areas is signposted. 
  
101. You wish to overtake a farm tractor with a mounted implement extending beyond its back. What must you remember?  
✅ The rear lights may be heavily soiled or concealed, making direction signals difficult or impossible to see when they are on  
❌ Farm tractors can always be overtaken safely due to their low speed  
✅ The mounted implement can swing out when the tractor turns off  
  
102. Where is parking prohibited?  
✅ Before sunken kerbstones  
❌ Immediately behind pedestrian crossings  
✅ At the edge of the roadway if this would prevent others from using designated parking areas  
**Comment**:  If you leave your vehicle or stop for more than 3 minutes, you are parking. Parking is not permitted everywhere. It is prohibited, for example, in front of kerbs and on the edge of the road if this prevents 
the use of marked parking spaces.

104. At junctions without priority traffic signs or traffic lights, the vehicle coming from the right has right of way.  
Here I have to let the vehicle coming from the right go first. Then I drive. Oncoming traffic turning left must wait until everything is clear.  
  
105. What is true of permanently illuminated signs?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_37_007.jpg)  
❌ Permanently illuminated signs apply to multi-track motor vehicles only  
✅ Vehicles may not stop at the side of carriageways with permanently illuminated signs  
✅ Permanently illuminated signs either block lanes or open them up to traffic  
**Comment**:  Permanent light signals close lanes or open them to traffic: Red crossed diagonal beams close a lane. Because it may be open to oncoming traffic and because the permanent light signals can be changed, 
stopping is prohibited in all lanes.   

106. Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The oncoming vehicle and I are on the priority road. The vehicle on the left must “give way”.  
However, as a left-turning driver, I must allow the oncoming vehicle to turn before I drive.  
  
107. Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The vehicle from the right and I ride on the priority road that bends to the right.  
The vehicle on the right follows the course of the priority road. I have to let him pass first because I want to leave the priority road.  
The vehicle on the side road must “give way” to all others.  
  
108. During traffic congestion, what parts of the road infrastructure must be kept clear?  
✅ Pedestrian crossings  
✅ Traffic confluences  
❌ Bus stops  
**Comment**:  I have to keep junctions, road junctions and level crossings clear when traffic is at a standstill.  
Even if I actually have priority, I must not drive on. I must also keep crosswalks clear in such situations.  
Buses move along with the flow of traffic. I have to drive past their stops if possible so that I don't block them.  
  
109. At junctions without priority traffic signs or traffic lights, the vehicle coming from the right has right of way.  
Here I have to let the vehicle coming from the right go first. Then I drive. Oncoming traffic turning left must wait until everything is clear.  
  
110. Which are the areas you must not drive into when there is traffic congestion?  
✅ Crossroads  
❌ Driveways  
✅ Level crossings  
**Comment**:  You must keep intersections, road junctions and railroad crossings clear in slow-moving traffic.  
Even if you actually have the right of way, you must not drive on. You must also keep crosswalks clear in such situations.  
  
111. What is correct in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_37_015.jpg)
❌ I have to wait in the centre of the junction  
❌ I must allow the oncoming traffic to pass through  
✅ I may turn unimpeded  
**Comment**:  The traffic light is green and left-turning drivers in this situation normally have to let oncoming traffic pass before 
turning. However, the green arrow on the left behind the intersection indicates that oncoming traffic has red. You can therefore turn 
left quickly here, oncoming traffic must wait.  
  
112. What must you be aware of here? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_05_107_1.jpg)  
✅ That children may run onto the road  
✅ Of vehicles speeding  
✅ That junctions will not be noticed  
**Comment**:  People often drive too fast in residential areas, especially if the roads appear wide and clear. It is easy  
to overlook junctions because they look like driveways. There is also a risk of children unexpectedly running out of driveways  
onto the road.  
  
113. What do you have to watch out for, when crossing a priority road?  
I watch out for  
✅ the weather conditions  
✅ the speed and the distance of the cross traffic  
✅ the width of the priority road  
**Comment**:  Faster traffic is to be expected on a priority road. To cross safely, I must therefore take into account  
the width of the road, my ability to accelerate, the speed of cross traffic and the weather conditions (e.g. wet conditions).  
  
114. What is the right course of action?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_09_121.jpg)
✅ I have to allow the cyclist to pass through  
✅ I have to wait at the stop line  
❌ I may make the turn in front of the cyclist  
**Comment**:  At this junction, you must observe the “Stop” sign and stop at the stop line. If you are turning left,  
you must allow the oncoming cyclist riding straight ahead to pass.  
  
115. How should you behave in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_37_010.jpg)  
❌ Stop on the line of sight  
✅ Pass through the crossing without stopping  
❌ Stop on the stop line  
**Comment**:  “Traffic lights before traffic signs": If traffic lights and traffic signs conflict at a junction, the  
traffic light signal takes precedence. The traffic sign only comes into effect if the traffic light fails or the yellow  
flashing light is on. In this case, you can cross the intersection without stopping, as the traffic light is green.  
  
116. What do you have to be aware of when you see this traffic sign combination? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_136.jpg)  
✅ If I am following the priority road, I have to signal a left-turn  
❌ The direction of traffic to the left is prescribed  
❌ If I continue driving straight ahead, I have to signal a right-turn  
**Comment**:  This traffic sign combination indicates that the priority road bends to the left. If you follow the priority road, you must turn left.  
Pay particular attention to pedestrians; you may have to wait.  
  
117. What is the right course of action?  
❌ The tram must allow me to make the turn first  
✅ I have to allow the green vehicle to pass through  
✅ I have to allow the tram to pass through  
**Comment**:  Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. My oncoming traffic and I must “give way” and allow the streetcar to pass.  
As I want to turn left, I must also allow the oncoming vehicle to pass before I turn.  
  
118. What must you be prepared for here?  
✅ People walking on the road  
✅ Vehicles turning onto the road  
✅ Oncoming vehicles turning left  
**Comment**:  Indication of a parking lot for hikers: With this traffic sign, not only pedestrians (e.g. from the parking lot towards 
the forest) are to be expected. Other vehicles from oncoming traffic could also approach the parking lot or drivers leaving the parking  
lot could turn onto my lane without paying attention.  
  
119. What is allowed in the zone which starts here?  
❌ Parking, provided a parking disc is used  
✅ Stopping for up to 3 minutes  
✅ Stopping for loading or unloading as well as boarding or alighting  
**Comment**:  The restricted stopping ban applies within the entire area. It is permitted to stop on the carriageway for up to 3  
minutes. You may also stop for longer to load or unload and to get in or out of the vehicle, but without unnecessary delay.  
  
120. What do these traffic signs indicate? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_131.jpg)  
✅ Start of a no-overtaking area 200 m ahead  
❌ No overtaking for 200 m  
❌ End of a no-overtaking area 200 m ahead  
**Comment**:  Multi-lane motor vehicles (cars, trucks) and motorcycles with sidecars may not be overtaken. The no overtaking zone is 3  
km long. Overtaking motorcycles without sidecars, mopeds, streetcars and non-motorized vehicles is permitted.  
  
121. What must you reckon with when you see these traffic signs?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_115.jpg)  
❌ The roadway narrowing for 50 m  
❌ A road widening 50 m ahead  
✅ The roadway narrowing approximately 50 m ahead  
**Comment**:  The traffic sign combination indicates a lane narrowing. The additional sign indicates the distance to the narrowing, in  
this case 50m. Adjust your speed and pay attention to oncoming traffic.  
  
122. Which vehicles are allowed to park here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_112.jpg)  
✅ Vehicles with a permissible total mass of up to 2.8 t  
✅ Motorcycles  
❌ Vehicles with a permissible total mass of more than 3.5 t  
**Comment**:  Vehicles with a maximum permissible mass of up to 2.8 tons may park on the sidewalk in the manner indicated.  
This includes motor vehicles as well as motorcycles and trailers.  
  
123. What applies from this traffic sign onwards?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_42_101.jpg)  
✅ Parking cars may be safely marked with parking light  
✅ You may not sound your horn to signal your intention to overtake  
❌ You may drive with parking light in the darkness  
**Comment**:  This traffic sign is located at the beginning of a built-up area. Within built-up areas, you must not sound the  
horn to indicate your intention to overtake. Parked cars may be secured with the parking light.  
  
124. What do you do when you see this traffic sign?(Sign. 308 ❌Priority over oncoming traffic. There is a narrow passage ahead.)  
✅ You must be ready to stop despite taking precedence  
✅ You may only take precedence when the narrowing is clear  
❌ You must give precedence to the oncoming traffic  
**Comment**:  The sign is in front of a narrowed lane. Anyone driving in the direction of the white arrow has priority over  
oncoming traffic. Oncoming traffic must wait. If you have priority, you must still be prepared to stop and may only use the  
priority if the lane is clear.  
  
125. How should you act at a point of danger indicated by this sign?   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_150.jpg)   
I should  
✅ avoid sudden manoeuvres  
✅ maintain the greatest possible distance to the vehicle ahead  
✅ avoid rapid acceleration  
**Comment**:  The danger sign with this symbol warns of special danger situations after road repair work, e.g. due to grit.  
This can make the road slippery and cause damage to the paintwork: it is essential to reduce speed, keep your distance and  
avoid sharp steering movements!  
  
126. When must you wait at this traffic sign? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_001.jpg)  
✅ When a rail vehicle is approaching  
✅ When a railway employee is waving a white-red-white flag  
✅ When the level crossing cannot be crossed without having to stop on it  
**Comment**:  The St. Andrew's cross is usually located directly in front of a level crossing and indicates that priority  
must be given to rail traffic. You must wait in front of the sign if a rail vehicle is approaching or a railroad employee  
is waving a white-red-white flag. If you are unable to cross the crossing without stopping due to slow-moving traffic, you  
must also wait in front of it.  
  
127. Which vehicles are you allowed to overtake where you see this traffic sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_129.jpg)  
❌ Motorcycle with sidecar  
✅ Motorcycle without sidecar  
❌ Car  
**Comment**:  Overtaking is prohibited here for motor vehicles of all kinds. Multi-track motor vehicles (cars, trucks) and  
motorcycles with sidecars may not be overtaken. Overtaking motorcycles without sidecars, mopeds, streetcars and non-motorized  
vehicles is permitted.  
  
128. What must you anticipate with this road sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_143.jpg)  
✅ You are nearing a hard right-hand bend  
✅ Oncoming traffic might cut the corner  
✅ Vehicles in front of me might slow down sharply  
**Comment**:  This sign warns of a sharp right-hand bend, the course of which may be more dangerous than is apparent at first  
glance. What to do at this traffic sign: Do not enter too quickly, reduce speed if necessary and watch out for vehicles ahead.  
Drive as far to the right as possible: Oncoming vehicles could cut the bend.  
  
129. What ends here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_136.jpg)  
❌ A no-stopping area  
✅ A no-waiting area  
❌ All previous zonal prohibitions  
**Comment**:  The traffic sign ends a zone with a restricted no-stopping zone.  
  
130. What does this traffic sign combination mean to you?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_141.jpg)  
❌ If I continue driving straight ahead, I have to allow right of way to vehicles arriving from the right  
❌ I am not permitted to turn right or drive straight ahead  
✅ I am on a priority road that bends left  
**Comment**:  The additional sign below the “priority road” traffic sign indicates that this is a turning priority road.  
The thick line on the additional sign shows the further course of the priority road. So I stay on the priority road when  
I turn left here.  
  
131. What should you do as you draw near to this heavy goods transport?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_36_001_1.jpg)  
❌ I overtake taking extra care  
✅ I refrain from overtaking  
✅ I move into the right-hand lane  
**Comment**:  Even if the general traffic signs permit a higher speed here, the illuminated sign on the escort vehicle 
takes precedence. It indicates that overtaking is prohibited. Below it, an additional sign explains that this is a heavy 
goods vehicle (with excess width). So I don't overtake and switch to the right-hand lane until one of us turns or the  
escort vehicle signals that overtaking is possible.  
  
132. What must you observe when parking here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_111.jpg)

136. What does this traffic sign indicate? (Up arrow and below U3 in a Yellow board)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_135.jpg)  
✅ A numbered diversion  
❌ A numbered underground car park  
❌ Tram line no. 3  
**Comment**:  The sign(Das Zeichen) indicates the start of a detour(diversion) route. Where it is necessary to distinguish  
between several detour routes, it may be numbered (numbered detour route).  
  
137. Which vehicles are not allowed to use a road sign-posted like this?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_118.jpg)  
❌ Motorcycles  
✅ Cars  
✅ Trucks  
**Comment**:  The sign prohibits motor vehicles and other multi-lane motor vehicles from driving on the road.

138. What must you be aware of when you see this road traffic sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_153.jpg)  
✅ Avoid stopping and parking  
✅ Stones may be lying on the roadway  
✅ Vehicles in front may brake suddenly  
**Comment**:  The danger sign(Das Gefahrzeichen) with this symbol warns of particular dangers(Gefahrenlagen) due to falling  
rocks(durch Steinschlag - through falling rocks). Here I drive attentively, watch out for vehicles ahead and for obstacles  
(boulders) on the road: if necessary, I reduce speed!  
  
139. What do you do when you see this traffic sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_004.jpg)   
✅ When there are two lanes in one direction, employ the zipper feed-in method  
✅ Give precedence to oncoming traffic  
❌ Where there are two lanes in one direction and you are driving on the left lane, you take absolute precedence  
**Comment**:  The traffic sign indicates a narrowing of your own lane, so you must give priority to oncoming traffic.  
If it is located on a road with two lanes for one direction, the zipper method is used.  
  
140. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. What must you consider when you see this road sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_156.jpg)  
✅ The braking distance is longer  
❌ The braking response will be better if no gear is engaged  
✅ Applying the brakes for a longer time will diminish the braking response  
**Comment**:  The sign indicates a downhill gradient (the 2nd number is further down). The braking distance is longer downhill  
than on level ground. You would therefore have to brake harder and more frequently to achieve the same braking effect. But this  
is dangerous: the brake gets hot and the effect diminishes. That's why I let the engine do the braking and shift to a lower gear  
before the downhill section  
  
141. What applies with this traffic sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_162.jpg)

✅ I have to signal a right-turn  
❌ I may also continue driving by taking a left turn  
**Comment**:  I may only continue in the direction of the arrow at this sign. Any other direction is prohibited. Here I must  
turn right before the traffic sign. When doing so, I must indicate the change of direction by flashing my lights, as I would  
when turning “voluntarily”.  
  
142. What must you anticipate when you see this road sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_010.jpg)  
✅ A pedestrian crossing that is hard to see  
✅ Pedestrians that might cross the road  
❌ Pedestrians who may only cross the road from the right  
**Comment**:  The danger sign with this symbol warns of particular dangers posed by pedestrians. It indicates a crosswalk.  
I drive carefully here and watch out for vehicles in front: If necessary, I reduce my speed!  
  
143. What vehicles may enter a zone with this sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_021.jpg)  
✅ Vehicles driven by residents  
✅ Small electric vehicles  
✅ Bicycles  
**Comment**: Not all vehicles are prohibited in this area; in addition to bicycles and electric vehicles, other vehicles  
may also enter the zone if they are driven by residents. This can also include cars and motorcycles, for example. Because  
“residents” are the people who live in this street.  
  
144. You pass this traffic sign while driving outside a built-up area. How far off is the hazard to be expected?  
(Red triangular border on a white background with Blac exclaimation mark in the middle)

❌ Between 250 m and 350 m  
✅ Between 150 m and 250 m  
**Comment**:  This traffic sign warns of a danger zone; an additional sign may indicate the danger in more detail. As a rule,  
the danger(or hazardous - Gefahrenstelle) zone is to be expected at a distance of around 150 to 250 m outside built-up areas.  
In urban areas, the distance (Abstand) may be considerably(deutlich) shorter(kürzer).  
  
145. What applies when you see this traffic sign? (Yellow board with City name mentioned as Mehlem Stadt Bonn)  
I may  
❌ drive faster than 50 km/h because this is a multi-lane carriageway  
✅ drive more quickly in the right-hand lane than vehicles travelling in the left-hand lane  
✅ choose whatever lane I wish for my direction of travel  
**Comment**:  The rules for driving within built-up(place name sign -Ortsschild) areas apply directly from the town sign: Top  
speed (Höchstgeschwindigkeit) 50 km/h and -if there are several lanes (Fahrstreifen) for one direction(Richtung) -free choice  
of lane (for vehicles up to 3.5 t gross vehicle weight). This also means that I can drive faster in the right-hand lane than  
in the left-hand lane. - but not faster than 50 km/h. In fact, multi-lane carriageways have nothing to do with speed limits.  
More than 50 km/h is only permitted if a traffic sign permits a different speed limit.

traffic sign.  
  
148. What applies with this traffic sign? (Left Down Arrow in the blue circular background)  
❌ I am obliged to turn left  
✅ I have to drive past obstructions on the left  
❌ I may not turn right before the sign  
**Comment**:  This traffic sign specifies the side on which you must drive past traffic islands, obstacles, roadworks, etc. I must pass 
on the left here. A corresponding arrow indicates that you must pass on the right.

![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_36_001.jpg)   
✅ I refrain from overtaking  
❌ I overtake taking extra care  
✅ I move into the right-hand lane  
**Comment**:  Even if the general traffic signs permit a higher speed here, the illuminated sign on the escort vehicle takes precedence.  
It indicates that overtaking is prohibited. Below it, an additional sign explains that this is a heavy goods vehicle (with excess width).  
So I don't overtake and switch to the right-hand lane until one of us turns or the escort vehicle signals that overtaking is possible.  
  
151 What does this traffic sign indicate? (Zoll Duane)

❌ The roadway widens into three lanes  
✅ Traffic congestion  
✅ The vehicles driving in front may suddenly brake  
**Comment**:  This sign is erected on a stretch of road with regular congestion, e.g. when the end of a traffic jam is not visible  
from a long distance at blind spots. You should therefore anticipate sudden braking by the vehicle in front.  
  
153. What must you be aware of when you see this road traffic sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_152.jpg)

❌ The entrance and exit point must be kept clear for amphibious vehicles  
✅ When it is dark or visibility is poor, areas of water are difficult to distinguish from the road  
**Comment**:  The danger sign with this symbol warns of particularly dangerous situations due to unsurfaced banks.  
It is best not to blindly follow the navigation device and pay attention to signs: I need to reduce my speed and make sure the road is passable.  
  
154. What must you remember when you see this traffic sign? (A lady with kinder)  
✅ You may not drive a motor vehicle in this pedestrian precinct (area)  
❌ You may drive a motor vehicle at walking speed in this pedestrian precinct

155. What must you anticipate with this road sign? (A danger sign with the symbol of a cattle)  
✅ Farm livestock on the roadway  
❌Wild animals crossing  
✅ A dirt-covered roadway  
**Comment**:  The danger sign with the “cattle” symbol warns of special danger situations caused by cattle:  
I must expect dirty road surfaces or animals on the road and reduce my speed!  
  
156. What motor vehicles may enter an environment zone that has this sign?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_5_01_012.jpg)   
✅ Motorcycles  
❌ Motor vehicles that meet the requirements for a green particulate emissions sticker, even if no such sticker is attached  
✅ Motor vehicles with a green particulate emissions sticker  
**Comment**:  Low emission/Environmental zones (Umweltzonen) serve(dienen) to reduce (zur Verminderung) harmful(schädlicher) air pollution
(Luftverunreinigungen) in urban(städtischen) areas(Bereich). Only low-emission(schadstoffarme) vehicles(Kraftfahrzeuge) are allowed to drive here - provided the corresponding sticker (in this case GREEN) is displayed correctly. Motorcycles do not have a sticker and are generally free to drive.  
  
157. What can red-white warning plates on vehicles indicate?  
✅ A vehicle with excessive width  
✅ A trailer parked on the roadway within a built-up area  
❌ A vehicle transporting dangerous goods  
**Comment**:  In certain cases, red and white warning signs replace the lighting of the vehicle with its own light source.  
For example, they indicate a trailer parked within a built-up area. However, warning signs can also indicate a vehicle with excess width.  
  
158. You need assistance on the autobahn. Which information does the arrow on the roadside marker give you? 
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_43_002.jpg)  
❌ Next exit in the direction of the arrow

160. What do you have to expect after these traffic signs?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_106.jpg) ---IMP    
❌ An uphill slope 800 m in length  
✅ A downhill slope 800 m in length  
❌ The beginning of a downhill slope 800 m ahead  
**Comment**:  The upper part of the sign combination warns of a downhill section. The additional sign indicates the length  
of the road, in this case a downward gradient of 800m. A downhill section is a dangerous section because the braking distance  
is longer than on a level road and the braking effect may decrease.  
  
161. What must you remember when you see this traffic sign? (Red circular board with horizontal white strip)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_013.jpg)

✅ People walking on the road  
✅ Vehicles turning onto the road  
✅ Oncoming vehicles turning left  
**Comment**: Indication of a parking lot for hikers: With this traffic sign, not only pedestrians (e.g. from the parking lot towards the forest) are to be expected. Other vehicles from oncoming traffic could also approach
the parking lot or people leaving the parking lot could turn onto the road without paying attention.  
  
165. You are approaching this combination of traffic signs. What must you remember?

167. What do you do when you see this traffic sign? (Warning Traffic sign with Sharp bends)  
✅ Reduce your speed  
❌ Accelerate strongly immediately after the right bend  
✅ Drive as far as possible over on the right-hand side  
**Comment**:  This traffic sign warns of sharp bends, which can be more dangerous than is apparent at first glance. Behavior at this sign: Do not enter too quickly, reduce speed if necessary. Downshift if necessary. Drive 
as far to the right as possible.

observe this if you park your vehicle here. If you want to park there all night, you must make your vehicle recognizable,  e.g. with parking lights.
  
171. When may you stop here? (No stopping sign with bottom written as werktags)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_027.jpg)  
❌ On Saturdays  
✅ On Sundays  
✅ On public holidays  
**Comment**: The red and blue sign means “No stopping”. It prohibits stopping or parking on the carriageway. The additional sign “weekdays” restricts the prohibition to working days: Monday to Saturday inclusive count as 
working days. This means that stopping and parking is permitted by this sign on Sundays and other public holidays (regardless of the day of the week). On Saturdays and other working days only if a public holiday falls on a 
Saturday or working day.
  
173. What is true in the case of this traffic sign combination? (Bicycle with left and right arrow and also Give way symbol below it.)  
I have to give way while also  
✅ watching out for cyclists coming from the left and right  
✅ watching out for electric scooter traffic coming from the left and right  
❌ only watching out for motor vehicle traffic coming from the left and right on the priority road  
**Comment**:  The sign combination warns of cycle paths for both directions on priority roads. Not only do I have to give way, I also have to expect cyclists on the right and left when turning. Small electric vehicles 
(e.g. e-scooters) are also permitted on cycle paths.  
  
174. What does this traffic sign warn you of? (Car slippering warning sign)  
✅ Danger of skidding when the roadway is wet  
✅ Danger of skidding when the roadway is dirty

✅ Refrain from overtaking  
❌ Always stop before the road narrows  
✅ Reduce your speed  
**Comment**:  After such a sign, the roadway will become noticeably narrower. Adjust your speed and pay attention to oncoming traffic. Do not overtake.  
  
176. What do the white markings on the road mean in this situation?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_4_42_009_1.jpg)  
The white markings  
❌ are a warning about the poor state of the road surface  
✅ highlight a duty to give-way due to the right-before-left rule  
❌ indicate a traffic-calming zone  
**Comment**: The white marking on the road is called “shark's teeth” because of its appearance. It emphasizes an existing obligation to wait, in this case due to a right-before-left rule (intersection without right-of-way 
traffic signs). Other traffic signs with corresponding, clear symbols indicate “traffic-calmed areas” or poor road conditions.  
  
177. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. What is the correct thing to do when you see this traffic sign?  
(12% higher gradient from left to right in warning sign)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_157.jpg)  
❌ I always change up to a higher gear  
❌ I drive down this descent carefully  
✅ I change down to a lower gear if necessary

✅ drive more quickly in the right-hand lane than vehicles travelling in the left-hand lane  
❌ drive faster than 50 km/h because this is a multi-lane carriageway  
✅ choose whatever lane I wish for my direction of travel  
**Comment**: The rules for driving within built-up areas apply immediately after the town sign: Maximum speed 50 km/h and - if there are several lanes for one direction - free choice of lane (for vehicles up to 3.5 t gross 
vehicle weight). This also means that I can drive faster in the right-hand lane than in the left-hand lane. - but not faster than 50 km/h. In fact, multi-lane carriageways have nothing to do with speed limits. More than 50 
km/h is only permitted if a traffic sign permits a different speed limit.  
  
179. What does this traffic sign indicate?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_119.jpg)

between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., you can drive faster, usually 50 km/h in urban areas. There is no exception for electric vehicles.  
  
181. What does this traffic sign combination indicate?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_164.jpg)  
The road signposted like this  
✅ may be used by winter sports enthusiasts  
❌ may not be used by traffic in winter  
❌ may only be used with snow chains  
**Comment**: This combination calls for caution: The upper traffic sign warns of a danger zone. The additional sign permits winter sports. I must therefore watch out for winter sports enthusiasts here and drive at walking 
pace if necessary. 
  
182. What must you be prepared for here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_139.jpg) Sign 356

❌ That children will be playing on the road under supervision  
**Comment**: Traffic assistants (e.g. school crossing guards) support traffic control. Pay particular attention when driving and expect children to run across the road. Moving traffic can also be stopped to allow children  
to cross the road.  
  
183. Which traffic sign refers to the permissible total mass?  
(5.5 t in white background withred border  and Truck in white background with red border and 7,5t in bottom.)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_41_102.jpg) __2__
**Comment**: The first traffic sign indicates the maximum permissible actual mass. The second traffic sign refers to the permissible total mass.  
  
184. What do these traffic signs indicate?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_121.jpg)  
✅ No entry 100 m ahead  
❌ A customs post 100 m ahead  
❌ A one-way street 100 m long  
**Comment**:  The upper sign prohibits entry into this road. The additional sign indicates the distance to the no-entry zone, in this case 100m. Watch out for vehicles that may leave the road.  
  
185. What dangers can arise if this traffic sign is ignored?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_109.jpg)  
✅ The vehicle could go into a skid and endanger oncoming traffic  
✅ The load could be damaged  
✅ The vehicle could suffer a broken axle or spring fracture  
**Comment**: The sign warns of uneven road surfaces. If the speed is too high, the vehicle could skid and endanger oncoming traffic. In addition, cargo could be damaged or the vehicle could suffer axle and spring breakage. 
Therefore, adjust your speed. 
  
186. What must you anticipate with this road sign? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_154.jpg)  
✅ Vehicles that brake suddenly  
✅ Other road users may become distracted  
✅ Sudden noise from aeroplanes  
**Comment**: The danger sign with this symbol warns of special danger situations due to air traffic. I do not allow myself to be irritated by aircraft noise and drive attentively, paying attention to the vehicles ahead  
and reducing my speed if necessary!  
  
187. What vehicles may you overtake when this traffic sign is displayed?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_41_108.jpg)  
✅ No vehicles  
❌ Multi-track vehicles  
❌ Single-track vehicles  
**Comment**: StVO: The sign means “Prohibition of overtaking single-track vehicles for multi-track motor vehicles and motorcycles with sidecars”. The explanatory note goes on to say: Anyone driving a multi-lane motor 
vehicle may not overtake single - AND multi-lane vehicles. So none.  
  
188. What do the white markings on the road mean in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_4_42_009.jpg)  
The white markings  
❌ are a warning about the poor state of the road surface  
✅ highlight a duty to give-way due to the right-before-left rule  
❌ indicate a traffic-calming zone  
**Comment**: The white marking on the road is called “shark's teeth” because of its appearance. It emphasizes an existing obligation to wait, in this case due to a right-before-left rule (intersection without right-of-way 
traffic signs). Other traffic signs with corresponding, clear symbols indicate “traffic-calmed areas” or poor road conditions.  
  
189. What vehicles may be parked alongside other parked cars on the roadway?  
✅ All taxis when passengers get in or out  
❌ All vehicles when they have their hazard lights switched on  
❌ All vehicles when they are being loaded or unloaded  
**Comment**: Cabs (also: cabs) are allowed to stop in the second row to let passengers on and off if traffic permits. I should always expect this when a cab drives ahead of me.  
  
190. What actions should you anticipate at such stops?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_02_122.jpg)  
✅ Pedestrians will run across the road to the tram-stop island  
❌ Pedestrians will wait until the road is clear  
✅ Pedestrians will step off the tram-stop island unheedingly  
**Comment**: Pedestrians sometimes leave stops carelessly. It can also happen that pedestrians run across the road from the other side to catch the streetcar.  
  
191. What applies with this traffic sign? (No stopping and parking sign and below mentioned is TAXI)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_163.jpg)
❌ I may stop  
✅ I have to anticipate taxi moving off and coming to a stop  
❌ I may park  
**Comment**: Cabs have fixed stands that are marked with this sign. I have to expect cabs arriving and departing there. Only cabs are allowed to stop at the stands.  
  
192. What is the correct course of action in this situation? (Repeated but order changed)  
❌ I slow down to walking speed now  
✅ I maintain my speed  
✅ I drive with an increased level of alertness  
**Comment**:  The bus in oncoming traffic is parked in a lay-by next to the road without hazard warning lights. Therefore, I do not have to slow down to walking speed, but may maintain my speed (observe the speed limit!). 
Increased attention and caution are always required in such situations.  
  
193. What should you anticipate when pedestrians are crossing the road?  
Pedestrians can  
✅ be inattentive  
✅ come to a sudden stop  
✅ turn back, after half-way  
  
194. What is correct in this situation? (There is a truck coming from the incoming traffic in the same lane. And to my left and right both side are bike lane)  
I am  
✅ allowed to drive on the advisory bike lane only until I am past the truck.  
❌ not allowed to drive on the advisory bike lane  
✅ allowed to drive on the advisory bike lane after I have ruled out any risk to cyclists by carefully observing the road traffic situation  
**Comment**: There is no general ban on using the hard shoulder, but the hard shoulder is there for the safety of cyclists. If nobody is using the lane and I am not putting cyclists in danger, I can temporarily use the 
area with my vehicle, e.g. to avoid traffic. Once I have passed the bottleneck (caused here by oncoming traffic), I leave the hard shoulder again.  
  
195. What must you note when overtaking the cyclists in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_05_125.jpg)  
✅ The incline causes the cyclists to sway  
❌ I must overtake with at least 1.0 m of side clearance  
✅ I must overtake with at least 1.5 m of side clearance  
**Comment**: When overtaking cyclists, I always have to reckon with an unsafe driving style or a “swinging movement” to the sides. Especially on an incline. The prescribed minimum distance to the side when overtaking is 
1.5 m in urban areas (at least 2 m rural or outside urban areas).  
  
196. You would like to drive past a local transport bus, which has come to a stop at a bus stop. What must you be aware of?  
I have to  
✅ drive past carefully  
✅ watch out for oncoming traffic  
✅ drive past maintaining sufficient space to the side  
**Comment**: If a bus stops at a bus stop, you must expect people to cross the road in front of or behind the bus. Therefore, only drive past carefully and at a sufficient distance to avoid endangering passengers - be 
aware of oncoming traffic.  
  
197. What must you be aware of when driving a quad?  
✅ Wearing a suitable crash helmet is mandatory  
❌ The handling characteristics are similar to those of a car  
✅ Quads are prone to tipping over when driving through tight bends  
**Comment**: You are similarly unprotected on quad bikes as on motorcycles. This is why helmets are also compulsory here. When cornering, quads - unlike four-wheeled cars, for example - can have a tendency to tip over.  
  
198. Why must you drive slowly here and be ready to brake?  
❌ Because the blue truck is moving off  
✅ Because the traffic situation is confusing  
✅ Because there is a child on the carriageway  
**Comment**: Wherever the traffic situation is unclear, I have to drive carefully, i.e. slowly and be ready to brake. Especially if other vehicles slow down and flash their lights in front of me, if children can be seen at 
the side of the road or even want to cross the road: Stop if necessary. The vehicle approaching in oncoming traffic is of no interest to me.  
  
199. Why should you allow the truck to change lane? (Video question: The truck indicates with its flashing lights that it wants to turn left into my lane. )  
❌ Because the alternate merging procedure applies here  
✅ Because the driver of the truck may fail to see me  
✅ Because I should show due consideration to the truck  
**Comment**:  The truck indicates with its flashing lights that it wants to turn left into my lane. Maybe he didn't see me properly. Besides, it's not far to the junction: I let him go ahead out of consideration. The 
zipper procedure is only to be used at lane narrowings, not when changing lanes as here.  
  
200. You want to transport furniture in the van shown here (up to 3.5 t). Compared to driving a car, what do you have to be aware of?  
The van  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_7_01_161.jpg)   
✅ is vulnerable to sidewinds  
✅ can roll over more easily when cornering  
✅ requires special attention regarding vertical clearances  
**Comment**: Vans have a higher center of gravity than cars, so they can tip over more easily even when heavily loaded. The large surface area also makes the vehicle more susceptible to the influence of crosswinds. In 
addition, I have to pay attention to the clearance height on driveways or bridges, for example!  
  
201. What do you have to be aware of when you see this traffic sign? (Traffic calmed area sign, wherein children playing  
football with parent and there is car parked nearby. And sideways are housing society. And a car is an onccoming car on the lane.)  
✅ Pedestrians are entitled to use the entire breadth of the road  
✅ Motor vehicles have to drive at walking speed  
✅ Children may play across the entire road  
**Comment**: The sign is called “Traffic-calmed area”(Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich). Here, children are allowed to play anywhere and pedestrians are allowed to use the full width of the road. I am only allowed to drive at 
walking speed - i.e. no faster than 4 to 7 km/h. If necessary, I have to wait.  
  
202. A horse-drawn carriage is coming towards you. What should you do?  
I should  
✅ Avoid making noise  
✅ drive as far to the right as possible  
❌ switch on parking light  
**Comment**: Horses are living creatures(Pferde sind Lebewesen) that react differently(unterschiedlich) to their environment. To avoid making them unnecessarily(unnötig) nervous in traffic, I should be considerate, avoid 
noise and ride as far to the right as possible,  reducing my own speed if necessary.  
  
203. You want to overtake a horse-drawn carriage on a rural road. What should you do?  
I overtake with  
✅ as little noise as possible  
✅ the most space to the side as possible  
❌ a high engine speed  
  
204. What must you anticipate in this situation?  
❌ The cyclist will dismount to allow me to pass  
✅ The cyclist will pull out to the left  
✅ Oncoming traffic  
**Comment**: I have to expect that the person in front of me will drive past the parked car on the left. On this narrow road, I can only pass cars and others with caution, as oncoming traffic can suddenly appear. If it 
gets too narrow, I have to wait behind the obstacle or the person in front of me. I don't expect anyone to stop, dismount and let me pass.  
  
205. What must you be aware of?  
✅ Pedestrians could cross the road  
❌ I may not drive past the bus  
✅ I may drive past the bus at walking speed  
**Comment**: If a bus with hazard warning lights comes to a halt at a bus stop, other vehicles may only pass at walking speed: passengers or other people could cross the road at any time without paying attention!  
  
206. How do you respond to pedestrians wishing to cross the road into which you want to turn?  
❌ Only wait if the pedestrians are using a marked crossing  
✅ Allow the pedestrians to cross the road  
❌ Make the turn quickly before the pedestrians  
**Comment**: When turning, you must pay particular attention to pedestrians and wait if necessary. This means that you must  
give way to people who want to cross the road. It does not matter whether there are pedestrian crossings or traffic lights,  
for example, or not.  
  
207. Why are you particularly at risk, if you are riding a two-wheeler?  
✅ Because my speed can be underestimated  
✅ Because I can be easily overlooked  
✅ Because I am at greater risk of injury in the event of an accident  
**Comment**: The speed(Geschwindigkeit) and powerful(starke) acceleration(Beschleunigung) capability(vermögen) of many motorcycles 
are often(commly-häufig) underestimated(unterschätzt). Due to (Wegen) their narrow silhouette(schmalen Silhouette), motorcyclists 
are also easily overlooked. In the event of an accident, two-wheelers have a higher risk of injury due to the lack of(absent of 
- fehlenden) bodywork.  
  
206. You want to overtake a horse-drawn carriage on a rural road. What is the right course of action?  
✅ I maintain a sufficient amount of distance when pulling in again  
✅ I look for hand signals from the driver indicating he wants to turn off  
❌ I maintain the smallest possible side clearance  
**Comment**: Drivers of horse-drawn carriages are also allowed to move freely within the framework of the traffic regulations.  
When overtaking, I must therefore pay attention to whether the coachman wants to turn (does he give hand signals?).  
I only overtake with sufficient distance to the side so that I do not frighten the horses.  
  
207. What is the right course of action now? (Dog and child come near me, and I am at speed of 45km/hr)  
✅ I reduce my speed  
✅ Ich ready myself for an emergency braking manoeuvre  
❌ I continue driving as before  
**Comment**: Children rarely pay attention to traffic, especially when they are busy doing other things, such as walking a dog.  
Even if the child and dog appear to be far away (on the other side of the road), the sudden movement of the dog towards the  
road can be dangerous. TIP: Watch the movie again, watch out for movements on the left side of the road!  
  
208. How can you tell if a horse-drawn carriage wants to change direction?  
✅ The driver extends his arm  
✅ A traffic paddle is displayed  
✅ A flashing indicator  
**Comment**:  Drivers of horse-drawn carriages must also follow the rules of the road and, for example, indicate a change of direction.  
Depending on the equipment, this can be done using a turn signal, indicator or hand signal (outstretched arm).  
  
209. You want to exit the property lot. What is the right thing to do? (Picture wherein a two older people are crossing from open ended parking lot)  
❌ I sound my horn briefly so that the pedestrians will allow me to exit  
✅ I may drive on if the pedestrians waive their right of way  
✅ I have to wait until the pedestrians have crossed over the exit  
**Comment**:  If you want to drive out of a property onto the road, all other road users have priority. You must not obstruct  
or endanger pedestrians on the sidewalk. Stop early enough and wait. If the pedestrians wait and give you signals, you may  
drive (with consideration for other road users)  
  
210. You want to leave a traffic-calming zone and begin driving along a road. What should you do?  
I have to  
✅ allow pedestrians on the footpath to walk past  
✅ indicate the direction of movement prior to taking the turn  
❌ observe the "right before left" rule  
**Comment**:  If you want to drive out of a traffic-calmed area onto the road, you must indicate your direction of travel first.  
All other road users have priority. You must therefore allow pedestrians to pass on the sidewalk and give priority to vehicles.  
  
211. How is a purely electric vehicle different from a vehicle with a combustion engine?  
Purely electric vehicles  
✅ do not have any direct exhaust emissions  
❌ have a lower aerodynamic drag  
✅ have a lower engine noise  
**Comment**:  Electric vehicles differ from diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles primarily in terms of driving and engine noise  
and the lack of exhaust or exhaust fumes. Visually or externally, they can be almost identical: Air resistance, for example,  
differs depending on the model (such as sports car vs. SUV), not the drive type.  
  
212. What is correct in this situation? (Overtaking a cylist in front of a crosswalk)  
Here I may  
❌ only overtake the cyclist at a moderate speed  
❌ overtake the cyclist, because there is no oncoming traffic visible  
✅ not overtake the cyclist  
**Comment**:  Overtaking is generally prohibited in front of a crosswalk (also known as a crosswalk). Without exception.  
Maybe I have to stop for a pedestrian who suddenly appears and wants to cross the road?  
  
213. Having crossed the road, a person in a wheelchair cannot get up the curb and onto the pavement. What do you do?  
❌ I honk the horn and drive around the person  
✅ I get out of the car and help the person in the wheelchair  
✅ I stop and switch on the hazard warning lights  
**Comment**:  The wheelchair user is particularly at risk in this situation. Therefore, if possible, they should be helped  
to leave the roadway and overcome the obstacle - but in a safe way!  
  
214. What is the right course of action here?  
❌ I sound my horn to prompt the cyclists to ride one behind the other  
✅ I do not overtake the cyclists for now  
❌ I overtake the cyclists  
**Comment**:  When overtaking bicycles or small electric vehicles within built-up areas, a minimum lateral distance of 1.5 m  
is prescribed. I can hardly keep that distance here as long as the two are riding side by side. That's why I don't  
overtake for the time being. I am only allowed to honk my horn in case of danger or outside built-up areas to indicate  
overtaking (§ 5, § 16 StVO).  
  
215. What is the benefit of recuperation in an electric vehicle?  
✅ means that energy can be recovered from the braking operation  
✅ increases range  
✅ conserves the service brake system  
**Comment**:  The REKUPERATION technology can recover electricity when slowing down, braking or on downhill gradients  
(as a motor brake) while driving. This increases the range of my electric car and protects the braking system at the same time.  
  
216. A cyclist wishes -without dismounting -to cross the road at a pedestrian crossing. What should you do?  
❌ I only brake just short of the pedestrian crossing  
✅ I allow the cyclist to cross the road  
❌ I sound my horn and continue driving without giving way to the cyclist  
**Comment**:  At crosswalks, cyclists must actually dismount and push their bikes. If a cyclist behaves incorrectly and  
wants to cross the crosswalk without dismounting, give way and let them go.  
  
217. You are driving in the left-hand lane of a two-lane one-way street.  
About 30 m in front of you, a truck comes to a stop in the right-hand lane before a pedestrian crossing.  
What should you do?  
✅ I approach at a moderate speed  
❌ I give a warning signal and drive past the truck  
❌ I continue driving swiftly  
**Comment**:  Be particularly careful if your view of a crosswalk is obstructed. This applies, for example, if a truck stops  
in the right-hand lane and you are approaching in the same direction in the left-hand lane. Drive slowly and be ready to brake  
so that you can stop if pedestrians are crossing the road.  
  
218. You want to turn right. What must you be prepared for?  
✅ The truck will stop  
✅ The pedestrian could let the truck pass by and then cross the road in front of me  
✅ After the truck has taken the turn, pedestrians could approach from the opposite side of the road  
**Comment**:  Turners(Abbieger) must pay particular attention to pedestrians and wait if necessary. You must assume that the  
truck will stop. The person at the traffic lights may allow the truck to pass but go ahead of me. In addition, pedestrians may  
be coming from the opposite direction, which I will only see when the truck is no longer blocking my view.  
  
219. What is the right course of action? (You are driving on the right hand lane of a There is a bicycle ahead of you and then there is a truck standing on the right hand )  
I overtake the cyclist  
❌ between truck and bend  
✅ after the bend  
❌ before drawing level with the truck  
**Comment**:  As a driver with foresight, I can still see a blind bend after the obstacle. Only then will I be able to overtake  
the cyclist safely. Until then, only one thing is right: wait and see!  
  
220. What kind of behaviour must you anticipate from cyclists?  
Cyclists use  
✅ the wrong side of cycle paths  
✅ no lights when it is dark  
✅ one-way roads in both directions  
**Comment**:  Cyclists are dependent on the caution of others. I have to expect that they will not behave correctly:  
They are not always allowed to ride on one-way streets in both directions. Some use cycle paths in the wrong direction.  
In the dark, they are almost invisible without lights.  
  
221. Which vehicles must you allow to set off from marked bus stops?  
❌ Taxis  
✅ School buses  
✅ Regular buses  
**Comment**:  You must allow buses and school buses to depart from stops - by waiting if necessary.  
  
222. What makes driving in a stream of vehicles easier?  
✅ Driving in a slightly staggered position in your own lane  
❌ Keeping your hazard warning lights switched on when driving  
✅ Watching the queue through the windows of the vehicles travelling in front  
**Comment**:  Driving in a convoy is more pleasant if you can observe how the traffic situation develops. To do this, you can  
look through the windshield of the vehicle in front or drive slightly offset in your own lane.  
  
223. What benefit can be obtained by maintaining an adequate distance between you and the vehicle ahead?  
❌ It restricts visibility  
✅ It aids far-sighted driving  
✅ It helps reduce the risk of accidents  
**Comment**:  By keeping a sufficient distance from the vehicle in front, I can react in good time to the driving maneuvers of the  
vehicle in front and reduce the risk of an accident (e.g. rear-end collision). The view is not restricted, but significantly  
extended. Distance is therefore an important contribution to anticipatory driving.  
  
224. Your vehicle loses oil. How much drinking water can be polluted by a single drop of oil?  
Up to  
❌ 50 litres  
❌ 1 litre  
✅ 600 litres  
**Comment**:  One drop of oil can make up to 600 liters of drinking water undrinkable.  
The explanation: 1 liter of oil per 1000000 (1 million) liters of water contaminates water in such a way that it becomes  
undrinkable for humans. Converted, this is 0.6ml per 600 liters of water. 0.6ml corresponds to a large drop of oil.  
If you notice that your vehicle is leaking oil, e.g. an oil stain under the engine, you must have it repaired immediately.  
  
225. Driving within a built-up area, you want to overtake an electric scooter. What is the minimum space to the side that you must maintain?  
__1.5m__
**Comment**:  When overtaking, I must keep my distance from the vehicle being overtaken. Cyclists and electric scooters may only 
be overtaken with sufficient side clearance, which is at least 1.5 m in urban areas. When overtaking again, I must also keep a safe  
distance from the person being overtaken and not obstruct them.  
  
226. You are driving in foggy conditions on the motorway. Your visibility range is less than 50 m. How fast are you allowed to drive?  
__50__ km/hr  
**Comment**:  If visibility is less than 50 m due to fog, snowfall or rain, I may drive at a maximum speed of 50 km/h (§ 3 Speed, StVO).  
This applies on country roads as well as on highways.  
  
227. What should you consider after starting your vehicle?  
I should  
✅ drive at low engine speeds(it means low gear)  
✅ drive off as promptly as possible  
❌ if possible, allow the engine of the stationary vehicle to warm up  
**Comment**:  Allowing an engine to “warm up” is unnecessary from a technical point of view. After starting, it is best to drive 
off immediately and at low revs(lower gear). This saves energy and protects the environment.  
  
228.You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How does the reaction distance change in accordance with the rule of thumb?  
❌ It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m  
✅ It is doubled from 15 m to 30 m  
❌ It is halved from 50 m to 25 m  
**Comment**:  The reaction distance is the distance in 1 second, according to the rule of thumb: km/h “divided by” 10 “times” 3.  
If the speed is doubled, the reaction distance is also doubled: 50 / 10 x 3 = 15 and 100 / 10 x 3 = 30.  
  
229. You are driving on a narrow road. About 20 m ahead of you a child suddenly runs onto the roadway. When is a collision  
unavoidable despite emergency braking?  
At a speed of  
❌30 km/h  
❌20 km/h  
❌50 km/h  
  
230. You are travelling at 50 km/h, have a reaction time of 1 second, and brake normally. What is the stopping distance according to the rule of thumb?  
__40__ m  
**Comment**:  The rule of thumb for the stopping distance is: (speed in km/h:10) x 3 + (speed in km/h:10) x (speed in km/h:10).  
At a speed of 50km/h this means: (50km/h:10) x 3 + (50km/h:10) x (50km/h:10) = 40m  
  
Reaction Distance: Change the km/hr into m/s, and then get the distance covered in 1 sec, so it is 50km/hr*(3/10) = __15__ m/s or 15 m in 
1 sec. Braking Distance: (50km/hr/10)^2=(5^2) = __25__ m ; Stopping distance = 15m +25m = __40__ m  
  
231. You are travelling at 100 km/h and brake normally. What is the braking distance according to the rule of thumb?  
__100__ m  
**Comment**:  The rule of thumb for the braking distance is: (speed in km/h:10) x (speed in km/h:10). At a speed of 100km/h this means:  
(100km/h:10) x (100km/h:10) = 100m  
  
232. While driving, a deer crosses the road in front of your vehicle. What should you be aware of?  
❌ I can scare off the deer by turning on my main beam lights  
✅ Other animals might follow the deer  
✅ The deer might stop in the middle of the road  
**Comment**:  Deer crossing is a particular danger. Sometimes the animals simply stop in the bright headlights (high beam),  
and often one animal is followed by others. It is not recommended to switch on the high beam, but to switch it off (glare effect).  
  
233. What should you anticipate in this situation? (Bend in the road in a wooden area/jungle area)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_05_105.jpg)
✅ Wild animals crossing the road  
✅ Slow-moving vehicle on my side of the road  
✅ Fast oncoming traffic cutting the corner  
**Comment**:  I may be surprised by an obstacle behind a blind bend, e.g. a slow-moving vehicle on my side. Oncoming vehicles 
could also cut the bend. If my speed is too high, I may not be able to brake in time. - In wooded areas, there is also a risk 
of unexpected game crossing the road.  
  
234. You are driving a heavily loaded car. Why should you maintain a greater safety distance to the vehicle ahead?  
Because  
✅ the braking distance may be extended  
✅ the handling of the car may vary  
❌ my reaction time may become longer  
**Comment**: For heavily loaded vehicles, the braking distance may be longer due to the weight. The load also influences driving 
behavior. The reaction time (approx. 1 second) normally remains the same.  
  
235. Why must you be particularly careful here? (A car coming from the left and no traffic signal mentioned.  
The car can either go straight or to left and there is lots of leaves lying around on the road. This could be wet and slippery)  
✅ Because there is an increased danger of skidding when braking  
❌ Because the car coming from the left has priority  
✅ Because a vehicle could come from the right  
**Comment**:  Drive with particular caution because a vehicle with right of way could be coming from the right. If you then have 
to brake, there is an increased risk of skidding due to the wetness and leaves on the road.  
  
236. Why might driving along this road become dangerous?  
✅ Because poorly lit vehicles can be difficult to detect  
❌ Because oncoming vehicles will only be detected very late  
✅ Because persons on the road can be easily overlooked  
**Comment**:  The poor illumination can easily lead to pedestrians crossing the road in dark areas being overlooked.  
Poorly lit vehicles are also difficult to see in such areas.  
  
237. While driving straight ahead, you lose control of your vehicle due to aquaplaning. What is the proper response now?  
✅ I keep the steering wheel as straight as possible  
❌ I brake firmly  
✅ I gently take my foot off the accelerator  
**Comment**:  If I notice aquaplaning, I have to react quickly and carefully at the same time: I keep the steering wheel as straight as possible  
and carefully take my foot off the gas pedal. Braking hard would only increase the danger of the situation!  
  
238. What must you anticipate in this situation?  
✅ My vehicle may be forced leftwards  
❌ The truck ahead of me may be forced rightwards  
✅ When driving into the wind-protected area alongside the truck, my vehicle may be forced rightwards  
**Comment**:  If there is a strong crosswind from the right, motorcycles or cars may be “displaced” to the left (i.e. pushed away  
by the wind). I have to steer against this. If I then overtake a truck, I drive into its slipstream: The truck intercepts the wind   
like a wall. This means that when I enter the slipstream, my vehicle can initially be moved to the right, i.e. towards the truck  
(as if I were being pulled towards it). It is practically impossible for the heavy truck in front of me to be moved to the right  
against the wind: there is no slipstream for it there, at best it could be “pushed” to the left by the wind.  
  
239. Why are you not allowed to take the turn now?  Video Question: 
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_2_09_135_1_ende.jpg)
Because of the  
❌ yellow car  
❌ green vehicle  
✅ light blue car  
**Comment**:  When turning left with oncoming traffic, I have to expect smaller vehicles to be obscured by larger ones.  
In this case, a smaller vehicle appears next to the large vehicle in the oncoming traffic, which may be driving straight ahead.  
So I have to wait and let the oncoming traffic pass. The other vehicles are of no importance to me here.  
TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to the movement from the front!  
  
240. You are driving on a very narrow road and can see 50 m ahead. What must be your maximum stopping distance?  
✅ __25__ m  
**Comment**:  On narrow roads, you are only allowed to drive fast enough to stop within half your visibility. 
That means here: 50m : 2 = 25m  
  
241. When driving outside of a built-up area, what minimum safety distance should you maintain between you and the vehicle ahead?  
❌ One fifth of the speedometer reading in metres  
❌ One third of the speedometer reading in metres  
✅ One half of the speedometer reading in metres  
  
242. What amount of side clearance must you maintain when overtaking pedestrians and cyclists?  
I must  
✅ maintain a minimum side clearance of 1.5 m within a built-up area  
❌ maintain a minimum side clearance of 1.0 m within a built-up area  
✅ maintain a minimum side clearance of 2.0 m outside of a built-up area  
**Comment**:  Pedestrians and cyclists on the move need “room to maneuver” and safety. That is why I am only allowed to overtake  
them in built-up areas with a side distance of 1.5 m; outside built-up areas, the distance must be 2 m.  
Otherwise I am not allowed to overtake.  
  
243. What can you do to help protect the environment?  
I should avoid  
✅ driving in crowded city centres  
✅ driving short distances  
✅ driving at flat-out speed  
  
244. What is the permissible top speed generally in built-up areas?  
__50__ Km/hr  
**Comment**:  Within(Innerhalb) built-up areas, a speed limit of 50 km/h generally applies to all vehicles. Other speeds may be permitted by traffic signs.  
  
245. What manufacturer specifications will allow you to know if your motor vehicle is environmentally-friendly?  
From the details  
✅ about the efficiency category  
✅ about the emissions class  
✅ about the fuel consumption  
**Comment**:  Environmental protection begins with the purchase of a vehicle: Observe the manufacturer's information on fuel consumption,  
efficiency class and emission class.  
  
246. It starts raining. Why must you immediately increase the safe distance?  
❌ Because the brakes react more quickly  
✅ Because a greasy film may form which increases the braking distance  
✅ Because visibility may become worse and the windscreen wipers do not immediately provide a clear field of vision  
**Comment**:  When it starts to rain, road dirt can form a dangerous smear layer on the road, which increases the braking distance.  
Immediately after switching on the windshield wipers, a layer of smear often forms on the windshield as well, causing poor visibility.  
Therefore, increase the safety distance!  
  
247. Where is it permitted to flash headlights to indicate your intention to overtake?  
✅ In daylight outside built-up areas  
✅ In darkness outside built-up areas  
❌In darkness in built-up areas  
**Comment**:  Only outside built-up areas is it permitted to indicate your intention to overtake by flashing your headlights.  
Both during the day and in the dark. However, this must not dazzle other road users.  
  
248. What must you watch out for when you drive into an underground car park?  
✅ My tyres could get damaged by narrow entrances and exits  
✅ Pedestrians frequently walk on vehicle lanes  
✅ My eyes need to adjust to the change in lighting conditions  
**Comment**:  If the lighting conditions change suddenly, e.g. when you drive into an underground car park, your eyes first have to adjust.  
During these seconds, obstacles on the road, high kerbs at the edge of the road and pedestrians are harder to see. Drive with appropriate caution.  
  
249. What must you take into consideration when selecting your speed?  
✅ The condition of the road and traffic conditions  
✅ Visibility and weather conditions  
✅ Personal driving ability  
**Comment**:  You must always adapt your speed to the current circumstances. This includes visibility and weather conditions, road conditions,  
traffic conditions and your current personal abilities.  
  
250. What could make this situation become hazardous?  
✅ Oncoming traffic  
✅ The red car  
❌The tractor  
**Comment**:  The country road looks clear. I am overtaken just before the downhill section. This could be dangerous if something comes towards me.  
For me and for the person overtaking next to me! The tractor in the field has no influence on the situation. TIP: Watch the movie again and  
pay attention to the person overtaking (in my rear-view mirror) ❌at the end he is in the blind spot)!  
  
251. You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How is the braking distance changed according to the rule of thumb?  
❌It is doubled from 15 m to 30 m  
❌It is halved from 50 m to 25 m  
✅ It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m  
**Comment**:  The stopping distance is made up of the reaction distance and the braking distance. While the reaction distance increases in a straight line,  
the braking distance increases as the square of the speed, i.e. twice the speed = 4 times the braking distance.  
  
252. You are driving on a country road in darkness and rain and encounter oncoming vehicles with dipped headlights. What must you remember?  
✅ Your wet windscreen can result in your being dazzled  
✅ You can be dazzled by reflections on the wet road  
❌You can avoid possible dazzle by switching on full beam  
**Comment**:  In the dark and in the rain, be aware that the dipped headlights of oncoming traffic may be reflected on the wet road and dazzle you.  
In addition, streaks on the windshield can impair visibility.  
  
253. Where does aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) occur particularly often?  
❌At level crossings  
✅ Where there are grooves in the roadway  
✅ In dips in the roadway  
**Comment**:  In aquaplaning, a film of water on the road prevents contact between the road and the tires. Aquaplaning is facilitated by high speeds,  
worn tires, ruts and dips in the road.  
  
254. What is the right course of action now?  
❌I steer hard to the right  
✅ I avoid abrupt manoeuvres  
✅ I reduce my speed  
**Comment**:  I'm driving towards a large puddle. Shortly before that, I passed a traffic sign warning of the risk of skidding or aquaplaning in  
wet conditions. The oncoming traffic has obviously already started skidding. So: reduce your speed, no sharp steering movements.  
TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to the traffic signs!  
  
255. Why are you required to have a defective exhaust system repaired immediately?  
✅ Because parts of the exhaust system can drop on the roadway  
✅ Because of the noise pollution  
❌Because the engine would overheat  
**Comment**:  A rusted exhaust system is very loud and causes a nuisance to others. In addition, parts of the exhaust system can fall onto the  
road at any time and endanger others. Therefore, have the defects rectified as quickly as possible.  
  
256. What can cause in aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) on wet road surfaces?  
✅ Grooves in the roadway  
✅ Worn tyres  
✅ High speed  
**Comment**Aquaplaning means that a film of water on the road prevents contact between the road and the tires. The risk of aquaplaning  
is increased by high speeds, worn tires or ruts in the road (puddles).  
  
257. When must a car with trailer driving outside built-up areas on roads with only one lane for each direction keep a sufficient distance  
from the car in front so that an overtaking vehicle may pull in?  
When the combination of vehicles exceeds ___7__ m  
**Comment**:  On a road with only one lane in each direction, vehicles over 7 m in length, e.g. cars and caravans, must generally  
keep a sufficient distance from the vehicle in front to allow an overtaking vehicle to pull in safely.  
  
258. Where can used oil, lubricants and car batteries be taken to be disposed of properly?  
✅ To recycling centres  
❌In the household waste  
✅ To car workshops  
**Comment**:  Used oils, lubricants and vehicle batteries are hazardous waste. They must not be disposed of with household waste,  
but must be disposed of properly by the workshop or at recycling centers.  
  
259. What can be the effect of aquaplaning?  
✅ Reduced ability to steer the vehicle  
✅ Reduced vehicle braking capability  
❌Increased tyre static friction  
**Comment**:  When aquaplaning, a film of water on the road prevents contact between the road and tires. As a result, the vehicle cannot be steered  
or braked (it “floats”) and can drift off the road.  
  
260. You are driving in urban traffic on a dry roadway in a stream of traffic travelling at a speed of 50 km/h.  
What is the minimum safe distance you must keep from the vehicle in front?  
❌5 m or approximately 1 car length  
❌10 m or approximately 2 car lengths  
✅ 15 m or approximately 3 car lengths  
**Comment**:  In urban traffic, there is a special regulation regarding the distance: in good conditions (dry road, good visibility), the distance  
between two vehicles may be reduced to 15m. This corresponds to about three car lengths.  
  
261. What must you be aware of here? (A bright flash light in the urban road from the oncoming traffic, and several shops neon lights of various colours)  
✅ That you only detect oncoming vehicles after it is too late  
✅ That the traffic lights are hardly distinct from the coloured signs  
✅ That your vehicle will not be seen in time  
**Comment**:  Many different light sources cause confusion. Expect that you will not be seen in time. You will only recognize oncoming traffic late.  
Traffic lights hardly stand out from the neon signs.  
  
262. You are travelling at 100 km/h, have a reaction time of 1 second, and brake normally. What is the stopping distance according to the rule of thumb?  
Stopping Distance = Reaction Distance + Braking Distance  
And Reaction Distance = 100*(3/10)= 30m  
Braking Distance = ((100/10)^2) = 100m 100m  
So Stopping Distance = 130m  
  
263. You are travelling at 30 km/h. According to the rule of thumb, the braking distance is 9 metres when braking normally.  
How long is the braking distance under the same conditions when travelling at 60 km/h?  
__36m__  
**Comment**:  Braking Distance for 60km/h = (60/10)^2 = 36m  
  
264. By which rule of thumb can you determine from the speed the distance in metres a motor vehicle travels in one second?  
✅ (Speed in km/h / 10) x 3  
❌(Speed in km/h / 10) x 5  
❌(Speed in km/h / 10) x (speed in km/h / 10)  
  
265. What is the rule of thumb when calculating the braking distance for evasive braking on a dry, even and asphalted roadway?  
✅ ((speed in km/h / 10) x (speed in km/h / 10)) / 2  
❌((speed in km/h / 10) x 5) / 2  
❌((speed in km/h / 10) x 3) / 2  
  
266. What is the maximum speed a motor vehicle fitted with snow chains is allowed to travel?  
__ 50__km/h  
**Comment**:  You may only drive a maximum of 50 km/h in a vehicle with snow chains fitted.  
  
267. Why is it dangerous to overtake on this snow-covered carriageway?  
✅ Because parts of the carriageway may be iced over  
✅ Because my vehicle may skid  
✅ Because my vision may become even more negatively affected  
**Comment**:  Winter road conditions make overtaking dangerous here. There is slush on the overtaking lane and there is a risk of sliding  
and skidding. The danger is even greater because the road may be icy under the slush. In addition, splashing water or slush that has  
been thrown up can obstruct visibility even more than at the moment.  
  
268. You are driving a car with a caravan in tow. What is true regarding your distance to the vehicle ahead? (repeated question with option order changed)  
The distance  
❌is too large because it exceeds the length of my combination vehicle many times over  
✅ to the overtaking vehicle must be re-established once it has pulled back into lane  
✅ is appropriate because the overtaking vehicle can pull back into lane in front of me  
**Comment**:  On a road with only one lane in each direction, vehicles over 7 m in length, e.g. a car with a trailer, must always keep a  
sufficient distance from the vehicle in front so that an overtaking vehicle can pull in safely. If someone overtakes me, I must  
therefore restore the safe distance (if necessary by braking gently). There can be no such thing as too great a distance.  
  
269. In what situation does a driver frequently underestimate their own speed?  
❌On narrow roads with uneven road surfaces  
✅ On wide, well-finished roads  
✅ After a long journey at high speed  
**Comment**:  If you drive at a higher speed for a long time, you get used to it and tend to underestimate your own speed.  
Even on well-built, wide roads, your own speed often seems slower than it actually is.  
  
270. What can result from driving for a long time at high speed?  
❌Your reactions improve  
✅ You lose your feel for speed  
✅ You drive too close to vehicles in front  
**Comment**:  If you ride at higher speeds for a long time, you will get used to it. Your sense of speed diminishes. It is then easy to tailgate because  
you underestimate your own speed.  
  
271. While driving, how can you safely check whether the road is icy?  
✅ By carefully applying the brakes at very low speed  
❌By rapid acceleration  
❌By jerking the steering wheel to the left and right  
**Comment**:  Take extra care when driving on icy roads. By braking carefully and driving slowly, you can determine whether the road is icy and  
how the vehicle reacts.  
  
272. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox on a level carriageway. How should you change gears so as to drive in a particularly  
environmentally conscious and economical way?  
✅ Changing down again as late as possible  
❌Drive until the upper engine speed range is reached in one gear, before changing up  
✅ Changing up gears as early as possible  
**Comment**:  Fuel-saving driving is as balanced and anticipatory as possible in order to avoid frequent braking and accelerating. When accelerating,  
shift up early and shift down again as late as possible: Driving at low revs is economical and environmentally friendly.  
  
273. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. How can you achieve efficient fuel consumption?  
✅ By having the proper tyre inflation pressure  
✅ By adopting an even driving style with low engine speeds  
❌When accelerating, changing the gears upwards as late as possible  
**Comment**Environmentally friendly driving is as balanced and anticipatory as possible, i.e. balanced and at low revs. The correct tire pressure  
(see operating instructions, fuel filler cap or door frame) also makes a significant contribution to saving energy.  
  
274. What must you do to avoid endangering others by equipment or load which has fallen off your vehicle?  
Depending on the situation,  
❌proceed and inform the nearest municipal office  
✅ secure the danger spot and immediately inform the road service or police  
✅ remove the parts yourself  
**Comment**If you endanger other road users by dropping objects, you as the person responsible must remove the obstacles yourself or, if necessary,  
secure the danger zone and inform the police or road services.  
  
275. Where must you especially reckon with ice on the roadway?  
❌On frequently used stretches of road  
✅ On bridges  
✅ On stretches of road running through forest  
**Comment**:  Drive carefully and with foresight during the winter months. Freezing temperatures can cause the road to ice up.  
Especially on bridges and forest roads, the road surface is often icy when there is no danger of slipping and skidding on other roads.  
  
276. Which factors lengthen your braking distance?  
✅ Driving down slopes  
✅ A wet or slippery roadway  
✅ Towing a trailer not fitted with brakes  
**Comment**:  When we talk about braking distance, we are usually referring to normal braking on a dry road. A wet or slippery road surface,  
driving downhill or driving with an unbraked trailer increase this “standard” braking distance.  
  
277. Why should you avoid driving off at a rapid pace? ----IMP  
✅ Because of heavier tyre wear  
✅ Because the noise you cause annoys others  
❌Because this is a great strain on the rear brake  
**Comment**:  Do not start off with squealing tires and howling engine. This noise disturbs others. Starting off sharply is also not good for  
the tires ❌they will wear out more. (No connection to the rear brake given the book.)  
  
278. Why must you wait before taking a turn in this situation?  
❌Because of the pedestrian  
✅ Because of the motorbike  
✅ Because of the truck  
**Comment**:  When turning left, I also have to watch out for vehicles behind oncoming vehicles! Here there is a motorcycle in the shadow of  
the truck, which is obviously driving straight ahead. I prefer to avoid dangerous encounters when turning! Pedestrians to my right are  
of no importance to me here. TIP: Watch the movie again and watch out for movement in oncoming traffic!  
  
279. Why is it beneficial to use low viscosity engine oil?  
Because these oils  
✅ generate less friction in the engine  
❌can be disposed of as household waste  
✅ reduce fuel consumption  
**Comment**:  Low-friction oils reduce friction in the engine and thus help to save energy and reduce fuel consumption. However, oils  
should never be disposed of with household waste, but always professionally by the workshop or at recycling centers.  
  
280. What influences the degree of centrifugal force on bends?  
✅ The radius of the bend  
✅ Speed  
❌Headwind  
**Comment**:  Centrifugal force becomes effective when cornering: it wants to carry a vehicle out of the bend. The higher the speed and  
the smaller the curve radius, the greater the centrifugal force. It increases in proportion to the square of the speed, i.e. at twice  
the speed, the centrifugal force is four times as great. If you enter a tight bend at too high a speed, your vehicle will be carried  
out towards the outside of the bend.  
  
281. For which purposes is a horn allowed to be used in built-up areas?  
✅ As a warning signal  
❌As a calling signal  
❌As an overtaking signal  
**Comment**:  In urban areas, you may only sound the horn to warn others if you or others are in danger.  
  
282. Why are you not allowed to overtake here?  
Because I  
❌ may not cross over the central lane markings  
✅ cannot maintain an adequate passing distance from the cyclists if there is any oncoming traffic  
✅ do not have an adequate view of the road ahead  
**Comment**:  I am allowed to overtake the guide line, there are other reasons that prohibit overtaking. When overtaking cyclists outside  
built-up areas, a minimum lateral distance of 2 m is prescribed. I can hardly keep that distance here. In addition, the rest of the  
overtaking route is winding and not visible. That's why I'm not allowed to overtake here.  
  
283. You are driving in dense fog on a federal road (Bundesstraße) outside a built-up area. Are you allowed to drive in the middle  
of the road continuously straddling the broken white line?  
✅ No, because it could represent a danger to oncoming traffic  
❌ Yes, if fog headlamps and rear fog lamps are switched on  
❌ Yes, because it reduces the risk of running off the road  
**Comment**:  As a general rule, drive as far to the right as possible. Especially in fog, you should never drive constantly in the  
middle of the road or above the guide line. Otherwise you will endanger oncoming traffic.  
  
284. What should you do, if it is no longer possible to avoid a collision with wild animals?  
❌ I always take an evasive movement  
✅ I brake as hard as possible  
✅ I maintain my direction of movement  
**Comment**:  If a collision with game can no longer be avoided, I have to brake. I hold the steering wheel or handlebars firmly and  
try to maintain the direction of travel, i.e. stay on the road.  
  
285. What should you be prepared for here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_03_037.jpg)  
✅ For the poor visibility of my vehicle  
✅ For an extended braking distance  
❌ For increased tyre traction  
**Comment**:  The poor visibility caused by fog, rain and swirling water also makes my vehicle less visible to others. I have to expect  
this and a longer braking distance. Because the grip on wet roads does not increase, but naturally decreases!  
  
286. Where must you be prepared to encounter sudden fog?  
✅ Near rivers  
✅ In marshy areas  
✅ Near lakes  
**Comment**Fog is particularly common in areas where water is present. You should therefore expect fog to appear suddenly along rivers,  
in moorland areas and on lakes. Adjust your speed to the visibility conditions!  
  
287. What must you do on encountering sudden dense fog driving at daytime?  
❌ Only switch on parking lights  
✅ Adapt speed immediately to visibility conditions  
✅ Switch on dipped headlights  
**Comment**:  You should always adapt your speed to the visibility conditions, even in fog. To be seen better, you should switch on your  
dipped headlights in fog.  
  
288. For which purposes is a horn allowed to be used outside built-up areas?  
❌ As a calling signal  
✅ As a warning signal  
✅ As an overtaking signal  
**Comment**:  You may sound the horn at any time to warn others if you or others are in danger. However, you may only use the 
horn - and the headlight flasher - as an overtaking signal outside built-up areas.  
  
289. You are driving following a heavy rain shower. What should you be aware of in this situation?  
✅ I should maintain a large safety distance between me and the vehicle ahead  
✅ Splash water might impair my vision  
✅ It is difficult for me to detect uneven areas on the road surface  
**Comment**:  The braking distance is longer on a wet road than on a dry one. Splash water also makes visibility more difficult.  
That's why I always have to increase the safety distance on wet roads. This gives me a better view of the road and allows me to  
react in good time to puddles or uneven road surfaces, for example.  
  
290. What must you remember when refuelling?  
✅ Do not refuel when the tank is full and the nozzle has switched off  
❌ Fill up to the brim if possible  
✅ Do not breath in any fuel fumes  
**Comment**:  Do not refuel when the tank is full and the nozzle has switched off. Otherwise it may overflow and contaminate  
the ground. Do not inhale fuel vapors when refueling. Fuel vapors release volatile hydrocarbons into the air, especially benzene,  
which is carcinogenic.  
  
291. What is a pre-condition for environmentally-friendly and energy-saving driving?  
✅ Checking the tyre inflation pressure regularly  
✅ Performing vehicle maintenance regularly  
❌ Washing the engine regularly  
**Comment**:  The correct tire pressure reduces consumption and is part of energy-saving driving. Regular maintenance also ensures  
that the vehicle is as environmentally friendly as possible overall.  
  
292. You are driving in darkness on a well-constructed main road, using your dipped headlights. Within what distance must you be able to stop?  
Within the range of the  
❌ side lights  
✅ dipped headlights  
❌ main beam lights  
**Comment**:  In principle, I am only allowed to drive fast enough to be able to stop within the visibility range. In the dark,  
the visibility range is the same as the range of the low beam. The parking lights may only be used for parking, the high beam  
only if I have a clear road ahead and no other road users are dazzled.  
  
293. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. How can you reduce the fuel consumption of your vehicle? --❌IMP  
❌By driving at a high engine speed  
✅ By switching early up to the next gear  
✅ By employing an anticipatory driving style, to avoid frequent changes of speed  
**Comment**:  Fuel-saving driving is as balanced and anticipatory as possible in order to avoid frequent braking and acceleration.  
Shift up early when accelerating, as fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are most favorable at low engine speeds.  
  
294. Why does driving on this stretch of road require greater alertness on the part of the motorist?  
✅ A tram might come from the opposite direction  
✅ Driving on the tracks is dangerous  
✅ The road surface is uneven and road grip varies  
  
295. You are driving on a wide road on which oncoming traffic can pass by you, unobstructed. Within what distance must you be  
able to stop in any event?  
Within  
❌twice the distance readily visible to me  
✅ the distance readily visible to me  
❌half the distance readily visible to me  
**Comment**:  The following applies to driving motor vehicles: I may only drive as fast as I can control my vehicle. I must  
be able to stop within my range of vision, i.e. the distance I can see. Only on very narrow roads must I be able to stop  
within half the range of vision, and in the dark within the range of the dipped beam. Then I drive safely. The road here is  
well developed, so only the answer with the “single” visible distance needs to be ticked. Not half, not double.  
  
296. The road is icy for a short distance. What should you avoid here, if possible?  
✅ Braking  
✅ Steering wheel movements  
✅ Accelerating  
**Comment**:  Slow down on icy roads and avoid accelerating, braking and sudden steering movements wherever possible.  
  
297. Air resistance affects the fuel consumption of a vehicle. What affects air resistance the most?  
❌ The number of passengers  
❌ The profile depth of the tyres  
✅ The speed travelled  
**Comment**Fuel consumption increases dramatically at high speeds. The reason for this is air resistance: the faster I drive,  
the greater the effort required to counter the resistance and the more fuel is consumed.  
  
298. When driving outside of a built-up area, from what combination vehicle length must you maintain a large enough distance   
to the vehicle ahead as to allow an overtaking vehicle to pull back into lane in front of you? From a length of more than __7m__ 
**Comment**:  Trains over 7 m in length, e.g. a car with a trailer, must always keep a sufficient distance from the vehicle in 
front outside built-up areas so that an overtaking vehicle can safely pull in.  
  
299. What does the distance to be maintained from the vehicle ahead depend on?  
✅ Speed  
✅ Visibility conditions  
✅ State of the road surface  
**Comment**:  The main cause of rear-end collisions is insufficient distance from the vehicle in front. The distance to be 
maintained depends on visibility, speed and road conditions. The distance must always be checked and adjusted.  
  
300. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. What type of behaviour pollutes the environment?  
✅ Frequently pressing the accelerator while waiting at traffic lights  
✅ An uneven driving style  
❌ Driving downhill in a high gear  
**Comment**:  Environmentally friendly driving is as balanced and anticipatory as possible in order to avoid frequent braking 
and accelerating. If you drive unevenly or, for example, accelerate senselessly before a red light, you are putting unnecessary 
strain on the environment.  
  
301. What should you know about using the rear-view mirror?  
✅ I am unable to see vehicles and pedestrians in the blind spot  
✅ Rear-view mirrors must be adjusted to the particular driver  
❌ The interior mirror has no blind spot to the right-side  
**Comment**:  Looking ahead also means regularly checking the rear-view mirrors. It is important that they are correctly 
adjusted to the driver. But beware: you cannot see pedestrians and vehicles in the so-called blind spot in the mirrors! 
The only thing that helps is to look over your shoulder.  
  
302. What can result in your motor vehicle skidding while driving round a bend?  
✅ Driving too fast  
❌ Gently accelerating at the exit of the bend  
✅ Heavy oversteer  
**Comment**:  Centrifugal force is at work when cornering. It “pulls” the car to the outside of the bend, i.e. to the outside  
right in a left-hand bend. Therefore, reduce the speed beforehand. The faster I drive, the less grip I have. There is a  
particular risk of skidding in bends due to strong steering input.  
  
303. There is oil on the road. What should you do now?  
✅ I avoid heavy braking and abrupt steering movements  
❌ I swerve onto the left-hand side of the road  
✅ I notify the fire brigade  
**Comment**:  Oil on the road! A danger for the environment and for all those who drive along here. It is best to steer 
straight ahead and neither brake hard nor accelerate. Stop as soon as possible and inform the fire department so that the 
danger can be removed.  
  
304. In which situation is overtaking prohibited?  
If I  
✅ cannot complete the overtaking manoeuvre before a hill crest  
✅ cannot complete the overtaking manoeuvre before the start of a no-overtaking section  
✅ am unable to maintain the necessary space to the side  
**Comment**:  To avoid accidents, I am not allowed to overtake if I cannot keep enough distance to the side or cannot 
complete the overtaking maneuver before a crest. I must have completed or stopped an overtaking maneuver before the 
start of an overtaking ban.  
  
305. You are driving at 80 km/h behind a motor vehicle. What is the minimum safe distance you must observe?  
❌ A distance of 15 metres  
✅ A "distance of 2 seconds"  
❌ A "distance of 1 second"  
**Comment**:  Insufficient distance is one of the main causes of rear-end collisions. If the vehicle in front brakes  
suddenly, you need time to react. To avoid a collision during this time, the distance from the vehicle in front should  
always be at least 2 seconds, especially at higher speeds. Remember a fixed point at which the vehicle in front is passing.  
If you only reach this point after you have counted “21, 22”, you have at least a 2-second gap.  
  
  
306. How can you save fuel?  
❌ Avoid driving in top gear  
✅ By observing at least the tyre pressure indicated in the owner's manual  
✅ By removing roof racks or ski racks  
**Comment**:  To save fuel, you should drive with sufficient tire pressure - see operating instructions - and avoid unnecessary  
ballast. Roof racks or ski racks increase the mass of the vehicle and also the air resistance, which increases fuel consumption.  
You should therefore remove roof racks or ski racks if you do not need them.  
  
307.  What is the maximum speed you are allowed to drive a car with trailer on roads outside of built-up areas? __80km/hr__  
**Comment**:  With a car with a trailer, you may drive a maximum of 80 km/h on rural roads outside built-up areas.  
  
  
308. Why is it dangerous to overtake in this situation?  
✅ Because there is not sufficient space to pull back in between the vehicles ahead  
✅ Because vehicles ahead may swerve out  
✅ Because I cannot see far enough along the route necessary for overtaking  
**Comment**:  It seems as if the vehicle directly in front of me has other vehicles in front of it, which it is slowly catching  
up with. It's possible that one of the vehicles is about to pull out to overtake. I don't have a clear enough view of the rest  
of the route and we are approaching a left-hand bend. It will also be too narrow between the vehicles in front of me to get back  
into the lane. TIP: Watch the movie several times and pay attention to the movements of the others!  
  
309. Why should you not overtake the moped rider in this situation?  
✅ Because I am not allowed to drive significantly faster than the moped rider  
✅ Because I am unable to maintain the requisite amount of side clearance  
✅ Because this might cause the moped rider to fall  
**Comment**:  The road is very narrow due to the roadworks, so it is not possible to keep the prescribed side distance when overtaking.  
The motorcyclist could feel pressured, swerve and crash. In any case, I'm not allowed to drive faster than 30 km/h here (traffic sign  
at the beginning of the movie). Then I would only be a little faster than the moped (25 km/h). TIP: Watch the movie questions several  
times, sometimes you have already driven past the hint!  
  
310. You want to turn left. Which line should you follow?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_09_011_1.jpg)  
❌ The right driving line  
✅ The left driving line  
❌ The middle driving line  
**Comment**:  If you want to turn left, you must 1. indicate and 2. get into the center lane, both in good time. On one-way  
roads - e.g. one-way streets - I have to get into the left-hand lane as far as possible. In this case, it is a one-way street  
without two-way traffic (traffic sign “Einbahnstraße” in the picture above right). Without additional signs, I do not have to  
expect bicycle traffic here either: I must follow the left-hand lane.  
  
311. In what situation is it especially dangerous to perform a turn?  
✅ Before the crest of a hill  
✅ In foggy conditions  
✅ Before bends in the road  
**Comment**:  When turning on the road, I can quickly become an unforeseen obstacle for others. This is particularly dangerous  
in heavy and fast-moving traffic, in confusing traffic situations, in fog, in front of and behind bends or crests.  
  
312. I want to re-join the road. What is the correct assessment of this situation? (repeated question)   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_07_162.jpg)  
When they approach me from the rear  
❌ drivers give my priority in re-joining the road  
✅ drivers only see me late  
✅ I only see vehicles late  
**Comment**:  Before I drive off the edge of the road, I carefully observe my surroundings, especially the traffic behind me.  
Sometimes my view is obscured if, for example, a truck is parked behind me. I myself can only see vehicles approaching from  
behind late -and the traffic behind also sees my vehicle late. In such a situation, I drive forward carefully until I have a  
better view and wait for a sufficient gap to pull away.  
  
313. When are you in danger when overtaking?  
When the road user being overtaken  
✅ suddenly accelerates  
✅ swerves out to overtake  
❌ reduces his speed considerably  
**Comment**:  An overtaking maneuver must be stopped if overtaking becomes dangerous. This is the case if the vehicle being  
overtaken suddenly accelerates, preventing the overtaking vehicle from leaving the oncoming lane as planned. It also becomes  
dangerous if the person being overtaken unexpectedly pulls out to overtake.  
  
314. Why can it be dangerous to overtake on an unobscured, straight road?  
Because I  
✅ estimate the distance away of an oncoming vehicle as being too great  
✅ estimate my overtaking distance to be shorter than it is  
✅ estimate the speed of an oncoming vehicle as being too low  
**Comment**:  Overtaking becomes dangerous on straight and clear roads if I estimate the distance to an oncoming vehicle too far.  
It also becomes dangerous if your own overtaking distance is too short or if you underestimate the speed of oncoming traffic.  
Always stop overtaking in case of danger!  
  
315. You are waiting at a traffic light and want to turn right. What should you remember?  
✅ make sure there is no road user beside you on the right intending to go straight on  
❌ simply glance in the mirror to check that there is no cyclist behind you  
❌ concentrate fully on the turning manoeuvre because any cyclist has to wait anyway  
**Comment**:   You had to wait at a traffic light: As a right-turner, when the light turns green, you first check whether a road  
user to your right wants to continue straight ahead. You must first let other road users coming towards you from the front or  
wanting to continue straight ahead next to you through. This applies to the road and the cycle path and footpath next to you.  
  
316. Why must you discontinue your overtaking manoeuvre here?  
❌ Because the motorbike will overtake me  
✅ Because the tractor will turn off to the left  
❌ Because I can see a no-overtaking sign  
**Comment**: Overtaking maneuvers require careful consideration and execution. The risk of accidents is high and collisions  
can be life-threatening. Not only with oncoming traffic. The tractor's flashing lights indicate that it wants to turn left.   
The motorcyclist in the rear-view mirror has obviously recognized the situation and is keeping a safe distance behind me.  
There is no no-overtaking sign in sight: but it wouldn't change the fact that I am not allowed to overtake someone turning  
left in front of me.  
  
317. What is the right course of action now?  
❌ I overtake the car ahead leaving a large side clearance  
✅ I increase my distance to the car ahead  
✅ I continue driving with increased care  
**Comment**:  The driver of the vehicle in front of me is obviously having problems. For my own safety, it's better to increase the  
distance and watch the vehicle very carefully. Under no circumstances do I overtake here: I would only put myself in unnecessary  
danger. I stay behind and can help or call for help in an emergency. TIP: Watch the movie again in peace and literally “look ahead”!  
  
318. What can give rise to particularly dangerous situations where several lanes turn off?  
✅ Changing lanes while performing the turn  
❌ Keeping exactly to your lane  
✅ Driving too fast  
**Comment**: Drive very carefully when turning into multiple lanes. Dangerous situations often arise due to speeding and changing  
lanes while turning.  
  
319. To whom must you pay particularly close attention in this situation?  
To the  
❌ white truck  
❌ red car  
✅ cyclist  
**Comment**: Be careful when overtaking: You just saw a danger sign warning of bicycle traffic coming from the left and right. 
Where is the cyclist? Does the cycle path over there cross the road? Better stay alert! TIP: Watch the movie again and pay 
attention to the danger sign!  
  
320. When overtaking several trucks, you are faced with this situation. What should you do now? (You are in the left overtaking 
side of the road, wherein oncoming traffic can come. Also there is a bend which need to noticed in the picture, often ignored by 
ignored by novice people.)  
✅ I abort the overtaking manoeuvre  
✅ After pulling back into lane, I again establish an adequate safety distance  
❌ I continue overtaking quickly and pull back into lane in front of the red truck  
**Comment**: Overtaking before a bend is very risky. Oncoming traffic is visible far too late: stop overtaking in this situation. 
Get back into the right-hand lane and keep a sufficient distance from the vehicle in front.  
  
321. What should you do in this situation? (You drive in a lane wherein only one vehicle can pass and other side car came.  
You have sufficient place on the right parking area. And you can reach before the opposite car could reach there.)  
I move  
✅ into the gap to allow the oncoming vehicle to drive past  
❌ backwards, because the oncoming vehicle has right of way  
❌ onwards, because the oncoming vehicle has to reverse  
**Comment**: If vehicles approach each other in a narrow space, the person who has the opportunity to do so must give way, e.g.  
a parking space in the direction of travel: I give way and wait until the oncoming vehicle has passed.  
  
322. Why do you have to continue to brake?  
Because of the  
❌ cyclist  
✅ blue truck  
✅ refuse truck  
**Comment**:  A turning truck can become a large-scale visual obstacle and impair both the view ahead and the view to the side.  
Only those who look closely will recognize the garbage truck approaching from the right. TIP: Watch the movie again and watch  
out for movement from the right!  
  
323. When may a tram be overtaken on the left?  
✅ When the rails run too far to the right  
❌ When the roadway (not a one-way street) to the right of the tram is blocked by other vehicles  
✅ In one-way streets  
**Comment**:  In one-way streets or where the rails are too far to the right, you may overtake a streetcar on the left. If the  
rails are in the middle of the road, you may only overtake a streetcar on the right.  
  
324. You want to turn left. What difficulties could arise here?  
✅ Misunderstandings with oncoming traffic turning left  
✅ Traffic turning left can come dangerously close  
✅ Visibility restrictions caused by oncoming vehicles  
**Comment**:  Left turners usually have to turn in front of each other. This can make things tight. Dangerous misunderstandings  
can also occur if one driver wants to turn in front and the other behind: if necessary, use hand signals to communicate. Be aware  
that the other driver may obscure your view of other vehicles in oncoming traffic.  
  
326. Why are you not allowed to overtake now?  
Because of the  
❌ blue car  
✅ layout of the road  
✅ motorbike  
**Comment**:  Not everywhere can I overtake slower vehicles without worrying. For example, if I want to overtake a bicycle on 
a country road with an unclear road layout (bend): only with sufficient side clearance, because cyclists can swing back and 
forth while riding - and only if nobody is coming towards me. Vehicles far behind me are not decisive here. TIP: Watch the 
movie again and watch out for oncoming vehicles (motorcycles!)!  
  
327. Two vehicles approach one another at an intersection. Both vehicles want to turn left. What must both drivers do in the   
normal case? They must  
✅ turn in front of one another  
❌ communicate with one another to agree the mode of turning  
❌ turn behind one another  
**Comment**:  As a rule, drivers turning left oncoming traffic must turn in front of each other. I must also bear in mind 
that oncoming traffic can obscure the view of people driving straight ahead behind them.  
  
328. In which cases must you abandon overtaking?  
✅ When the road user being overtaken suddenly accelerates  
❌ When the road user being overtaken considerably reduces his speed  
✅ When there is danger from unexpected oncoming traffic  
**Comment**:  An overtaking maneuver must be aborted if the person being overtaken suddenly accelerates because the overtaking  
distance is dangerously extended. In addition, unexpected oncoming traffic can create a hazard that must lead to the overtaking  
maneuver being aborted.  
  
329. Why are you required to stop now?  
❌ Because of the white car  
✅ Because of the tram  
❌ Because of the cyclist  
**Comment**:  I am on a priority road. That's why the white car on my right has to wait for me. But the oncoming streetcar is  
turning left in front of me: I have to stop and let it pass. TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to traffic signs!  
  
330. You want to turn right at the junction. What is the right thing to do?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_07_019_1.jpg)  
✅ I change lanes as early as possible  
❌ I may only cross over the cycle lane at walking speed  
✅ I may not impede cyclists in the cycle lane  
**Comment**:  A protective lane for cycle traffic, here as a cycle path between two lanes: If I want to turn right at the next junction,  
I have to use a double gap. That's why it's best to change lanes as early as possible, so I have a reserve. I drive at the permitted  
speed so that I don't obstruct cyclists or other vehicles when I change lanes. If I had to slow down to walking speed, it would be far  
too dangerous for the cyclist behind me (rear-view mirror), for example!  
  
331. You want to turn left. Which line should you follow? (Einbahnstraße with Cycle to have bidrection)  
❌ The right driving line  
✅ The middle driving line  
❌ The left driving line  
**Comment**:  If you want to turn left, you must 1. indicate and 2. get into the center lane, both in good time. On one-way  
carriageways e.g. one-way streets - you must keep as far to the left as possible. In this particular case, however, cyclists  
are permitted to ride in oncoming traffic (traffic sign in the picture above right). The additional sign below the  
“One-way street” traffic sign shows a bicycle above two opposing arrows and means: “Cycling is permitted in the opposite  
direction”. I must therefore follow the center line of traffic and leave space for bicycle traffic.  
  
332. You are driving at 100 km/h on a road not inside a built-up area. In front of you a truck is travelling at 70 km/h.  ----IMP  
What is the minimum distance you must be from a crest in the road when commencing an overtaking manoeuvre?  
✅ 800 m  
❌ 400 m  
❌ 200 m  
**Comment**: As a rule of thumb, the overtaking distance is around 400 m if the car is 5 m long and the truck is 12 m long.  
When overtaking, any obstruction of oncoming traffic must be ruled out - the clear distance must therefore be at  
least twice as long as the overtaking distance - i.e. the crest of the road must be at least 800 m away.  
  
333.You want to overtake a truck with a trailer. What must you be aware of when doing so?  
✅ The necessary overtaking distance is significantly increased due to the trailer  
✅ The external bodywork of the truck-trailer combination may conceal vehicles ahead  
❌ You may only pull out to overtake once you are directly behind the truck-trailer combination  
**Comment**: Overtaking is one of the most dangerous driving maneuvers if you have to drive into the traffic space of oncoming  
traffic. The length of the overtaking distance depends not only on the speed and length of the vehicle being overtaken. I must  
also be aware that the outline of the vehicle in front of me may obscure the vehicles in front.  
  
334. You want to overtake. What should you do? Video Question:  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_1_06_008_1_ende.jpg)
I overtake  
✅ only if there is no oncoming vehicle  
❌ at the same time, as the quad bike  
✅ only if I have a clear view over the necessary stretch of road  
**Comment**: Overtaking maneuvers require careful consideration and execution. The risk of accidents is high and collisions can be  
life-threatening. That's why I only overtake when I have a clear view of the route ahead and only when there is no one coming  
towards me on a straight stretch of road. Overtaking at the same time as others is not an option, but increases the risk of  
accidents. TIP: Watch the movie again at your leisure!  
  
335. Is it irresponsible to overtake a truck and trailer a short distance before a crossroads?  
❌ No, because trucks and trailers mostly drive at low speed  
✅ Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of the crossing traffic  
✅ Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of important traffic signs  
**Comment**: Large trucks often obscure the view of important traffic signs and other road users in cross traffic. It would  
therefore be reckless to overtake a truck just before the junction.  
  
336. Which vehicles may be overtaken only by maintaining a specially great lateral distance?  
❌ Trams  
✅ Motorcycles  
✅ Bicycles  
**Comment**: You may only overtake bicycles, motorcycles and pedestrians on the road with a particularly large gap -at least 1.5m.  
You must wait behind them if there is not enough space for the side distance due to oncoming traffic.  
  
337. You want to turn left. To whom must you give priority?  
✅ Oncoming vehicles  
✅ Pedestrians seeking to cross the road into which I am turning  
✅ Oncoming cyclists  
**Comment**:  When turning, you must allow motor vehicles and cyclists coming towards you to pass. You must pay particular  
attention to pedestrians who want to cross the road. Wait if necessary.  
  
338. What is the correct procedure for pulling out to overtake?  
✅ There is no danger to the traffic behind  
❌ The vehicle in front indicates right  
✅ Oncoming traffic is not endangered  
**Comment**:  Overtaking is one of the most dangerous driving maneuvers when you have to drive into the traffic space of  
oncoming traffic. You may only overtake if neither oncoming nor following vehicles are obstructed or endangered  
during the entire overtaking maneuver.  
  
339. You want to turn right at the junction. What should you do? (There is no space left on the right because of chain of cars  
after the hurdle on the right.)  
❌ I steer clearly to the right, in order to create a space in the right-hand lane  
✅ I refrain from turning right, and remain in my lane  
❌ I wait until all the vehicles have passed by, and then I move into the right-hand lane  
**Comment**:  If I have “accidentally” turned left instead of right on a multi-lane road with directional arrows, I must first  
turn left, even if I actually wanted to turn right. I can then make up for the mistake by turning back or taking a different  
route (navigation system).  
  
340. You want to reverse park on the right-hand side of the road. What is correct in this situation?  
✅ I anticipate that vehicles may exit their parking spaces  
✅ I closely observe the oncoming traffic before manoeuvring into the space  
❌ I switch on my hazard lights  
**Comment**:  Wherever there are a lot of vehicles parked, you have to expect people to pull out. To reverse into a parking  
space perpendicular to the direction of travel, I need a lot of space. That's why I pay particular attention to oncoming  
traffic when turning into a parking space (my vehicle swerves out). The hazard warning lights remain off: Except when a vehicle  
is broken down or being towed away, the hazard warning lights may only be switched on if the vehicle endangers others or warns  
of danger (§ 16 StVO).  
  
341. You want to leave a property lot and turn into a road while passing over a footpath. What must you look out for?  
✅ Pedestrians on the footpath may not be endangered  
✅ You should be directed by another person if necessary  
❌ First take note of the flowing traffic on the road  
**Comment**:  If you want to drive out of a property onto the road, you must indicate your direction of travel. All other road  
users have priority. This means that you must also let pedestrians and cyclists pass from any direction and must not endanger  
anyone. If visibility is obstructed, you must be “instructed”.  
  
342. You want to turn left. When must you pay attention to the traffic following behind you?  
❌ After taking the turn  
✅ Before taking the turn  
✅ Before selecting the appropriate lane  
**Comment**:  If I want to turn off, I have to keep a close eye on the traffic behind before I signal and get into the lane.  
I then continue to keep an eye on the traffic behind and only turn when the traffic situation allows it.  
  
343. Two vehicles approach one another at an intersection. Both vehicles want to turn left. In what exceptional case do they 
have to turn one after the other?  
✅ If the road traffic situation demands it  
❌ If the vehicles are crossing over an equal priority intersection  
✅ If the layout of the intersection demands it  
**Comment**: Left-turning drivers coming towards each other usually have to turn in front of each other. However, this can  
lead to dangerous misunderstandings. If the traffic situation requires it or the design of the junction dictates it, e.g. by   
markings on the road, road users must turn one behind the other.  
  
344. Why can it be dangerous to overtake even on clearly visible, straight roads?  
Because the  
✅ the overtaking distance is longer than first thought  
❌ oncoming traffic is travelling slower than first thought  
✅ oncoming traffic is travelling faster than first thought  
**Comment**: On clear stretches of road, the speed of oncoming vehicles is often underestimated. As a result, overtaking can  
also be dangerous on these routes. In addition, the overtaking distance can be longer than expected.  
  
345. You are driving a slow-moving vehicle on a main road. How can you facilitate faster-moving vehicles in overtaking?  
By moving  
✅ onto the hard shoulder  
✅ onto the parking area  
✅ into a lay-by  
**Comment**: As the driver of a slower vehicle, you must allow faster vehicles to overtake. For example, pull off onto the hard  
shoulder, a parking lane or into a lay-by and wait there until the faster vehicles have passed. Swerving onto the hard shoulder  
is not permitted on highways.  
  
346. The indicator light is flashing much faster than usual. What could be the cause of this?  
❌ The fuse is faulty  
❌ The hazard lights are switched on  
✅ A bulb is defective  
**Comment**: If the bulb of a blinker is defective, I can recognize this while driving: The indicator light flashes much faster  
than usual if a turn signal has failed on the vehicle.  
  
347. In what situation is the eCall system designed to be triggered manually?  
✅ If a passenger suffers a medical emergency  
❌ If my vehicle sustains a puncture  
✅ If I am witness to a serious accident  
**Comment**: I can also activate the eCall system manually, for example if I witness a serious accident (i.e. my vehicle is not  
necessarily involved) and call for help for others or if a passenger suddenly needs medical assistance. If I have a flat tire,  
I call the breakdown service, not the emergency number.  
  
348. The brakes on your car are pulling strongly to one side. What effects can this have when you are braking?  
Anti-lock braking system (ABS) fails  
✅ Longer braking distance  
✅ Your car can veer to the side  
**Comment**: If the brake has a strong one-sided effect, the vehicle is not braked optimally: the braking distance increases.  
Due to the varying braking force, the vehicle pulls to one side and can swerve sideways.  
  
349. What are the possible consequences if the wheel nuts are not re-tightened following a tyre change?  
✅ The wheel can become detached from the vehicle  
❌ The tyre can become detached from the hub  
✅ The wheel may become damaged  
**Comment**: After fitting a wheel, the wheel nuts must be tightened to the torque specified by the vehicle manufacturer,  
otherwise the wheel may be damaged. In the worst case, the wheel may come loose.  
  
350. When should you arrange for the braking system of your car to be checked?  
❌ If I performed an emergency braking manoeuvre with my car  
✅ If the brake control light illuminates while driving  
✅ If my car fails to stay in line when I brake  
**Comment**: Safety depends to a large extent on the proper functioning of the brakes. If the indicator light warns you while  
driving, does the car not stay on track when braking? - Have the causes checked immediately at a workshop.  
  
351. You want to transport your holiday luggage on the roof of your fully occupied car. What must you observe? ----IMP  
✅ The gross vehicle weight rating of my car  
❌ The roof load specifications contained in the registration certificate Part I  
✅ The vehicle manufacturer's roof load specifications in the operating manual  
**Comment**: When loading a vehicle, I must ensure that the permissible total mass is not exceeded. It should also be noted that the   
roof can only bear a limited load. The information on the roof load can be found in the vehicle manufacturer's operating instructions.  
  
352. When must you arrange for your car to be inspected by a garage?  
When you detect defects  
❌ to the paintwork  
✅ to the steering system  
✅ to the chassis  
**Comment**: If I notice unusual driving or steering behavior on the vehicle while driving, this can have various causes. If I notice   
any safety-relevant defects, I should have my vehicle checked by a workshop as a matter of urgency. The paintwork is not safety-relevant.  
  
353. While driving, you notice that your car pulls heavily to the left when you brake. What is the right course of action?  
I should  
✅ have my car inspected in a garage without delay  
❌ only use the handbrake from that time on  
✅ only continue driving at low speed  
**Comment**: If the vehicle behaves unusually while driving, e.g. pulls to the left, this can have various causes. For my own safety, I   
should only continue driving at low speed and have my vehicle checked at a workshop as soon as possible.  
  
354. What must you check when transporting bicycles on a rear-mounted support system?  
✅ Whether lighting equipment or number plate are covered  
✅ Whether system and bicycles are fixed safely  
✅ Whether, according to the manufacturer's instructions, the system is adequate for the vehicle  
  
355. You are transporting furniture in a van. While taking a break you notice that a lashing strap is damaged. Under what  
condition may you continue driving?  
If I  
✅ have replaced the lashing strap  
✅ use other suitable load-securing equipment  
❌ continue driving at a maximum of 50 km/h  
**Comment**: If you discover that a lashing strap is damaged during furniture transportation, you must replace it before  
continuing your journey and either replace the lashing strap (reserves are always worthwhile) or secure the load with other  
suitable means. Simply driving on - at any speed - is not a solution, but creates an unnecessary risk of accidents.  
  
356. You note that the tyres on your vehicle's front axle are showing uneven amounts of wear. What should be checked? --IMP  
✅ The chassis settings  
✅ The shock absorbers  
✅ The tyre inflation pressure  
**Comment**: The tire tread should be evenly worn. If one tire on the front axle is more heavily worn, the suspension setting may not be   
correct. However, one-sided wear can also indicate permanently incorrect tire pressure or damaged shock absorbers. It is best to have   
this checked at a garage.  
  
357. How can driver assistance systems help you?  
Driver assistance systems can  
✅ help me perform driving tasks  
✅ intervene automatically in critical road traffic situations  
✅ warn me of danger  
**Comment**: Driver assistance systems can warn of dangers and help to safely master certain driving tasks. Without losing reaction   
time, automatic brake assistants, for example, can intervene in critical situations to save lives.  
  
358. You want to drive with a baby in the passenger seat. What do you have to be aware of when using an infant carrier?  
✅ If installed, the passenger airbag must be deactivated  
✅ The infant carrier must be positioned reversed to the direction of travel  
✅ The baby must be strapped into the infant carrier  
**Comment**: Baby carriers must be installed “rearward-facing” on the front passenger seat and the baby must be strapped in. If  
the front passenger airbag is activated, no rear-facing child seats may be used there. The risk of injury from the airbag is too  
great. A warning sign indicates an activated airbag.  
  
359. How can you detect your indicator is defective?  
✅ The indicator control lamp flashes faster than normal  
❌ The control lamp for the indicator is permanently illuminated red  
✅ By performing a functionality test before moving off  
**Comment**: A defective blinker can be a risk for me and others. I can recognize a fault, for example, during the departure  
check or when the blinker light flashes faster than usual in the display. Steady red indicator lights are reserved for other  
warnings, not for the blinker.  
  
360. While driving, you are using your motor vehicle’s active lane keep assist system. How can you manually override this driver     
assist system in the event that it intervenes?  
✅ By counter-steering  
❌ By accelerating  
✅ By activating the indicator  
**Comment**: An active lane departure warning system sometimes intervenes directly in the steering. However, like any assistance 
system, I can “override” it: By actively counter-steering against the resistance or by indicating, in which case the system is 
automatically deactivated so as not to impede my driving.  
  
361. Why are short journeys performed with a cold engine especially damaging to the environment?  
Because driving with a cold engine means  
✅ more fuel is consumed  
✅ the level of material wear is higher  
❌ the vehicle's battery will be over-charged  
**Comment**: Short journeys - especially when the engine is cold - consume a disproportionate amount of energy and therefore have a   
negative impact on the environment. Material wear is also increased.  
  
362. How does the active park assist help you when parking?  
The active park assist  
✅ detects sufficiently large parking spaces  
❌ detects all obstacles during the parking manoeuvre  
❌ checks if parking is permissible at a particular place  
**Comment**: Active parking assistants (also known as parking assistants) automatically recognize sufficiently large parking spaces and   
can take over the steering. However, they do not have all-round visibility or no-parking detection: as the driver, I have to be aware of   
possible obstacles or legal restrictions when parking.  
  
363. What is the function of your vehicle’s emergency brake assist? ----IMP  
The emergency brake assist  
✅ issues warnings about the immediate risk of a rear-end collision  
❌ brakes the speed of my vehicle if the event I accidentally overrun the traffic lane boundary  
✅ can reduce the risk of injury in the event of an unavoidable collision  
**Comment**:  Many driver assistance systems are designed for road safety, some for comfort. Emergency braking can be vital for survival.  
Emergency Brake Assist therefore increases safety by warning of the immediate danger of a rear-end collision and can reduce the risk  
of injury in the event of unavoidable collisions. This assistant does not react to the accidental crossing of a lane boundary line  
(e.g. the lane departure warning system does this).  
  
364. Your vehicle is equipped with a hill-start assist. What benefit does this assist system provide?  
When starting on a hill, the assist system can  
✅ prevent my vehicle from rolling backwards unintentionally  
✅ assume control of releasing the brakes  
❌ drive all wheels simultaneously  
**Comment**:  The term “hill start assist” refers to automated support when starting off on inclines, which prevents the vehicle from  
rolling back after stopping, even if the brake pedal is not depressed continuously. It automatically releases the brake when you  
accelerate. However, it has no influence on the drive.  
  
365. What should you remember when loading luggage into a car luggage compartment?  
I should  
✅ stow the warning triangle in an easily accessible place  
✅ secure the luggage against slipping  
✅ place heavy luggage at the bottom  
**Comment**:  When loading the trunk, don't just remember that the heaviest items belong in the bottom and the luggage must be 
secured. Breakdowns can also occur when traveling: Therefore, stow a warning triangle, safety vest and first aid kit within easy  
reach.  
  
366. You are using your motor vehicle’s lane keep assist system while driving. The system does not respond when you depart   
from the lane. What could be the cause of this?  
✅ A lack of lane markings  
✅ Heavy precipitation  
✅ Inadequate road illumination  
**Comment**:  The lane departure warning system helps me to stay in my lane (keep in lane). If the system reacts too late or  
not at all when changing lanes, this may be due to heavy precipitation, a lack of road markings or poor illumination of the  
road. Humans remain responsible for all assistance systems.  
  
367. While you are driving, the airbag control light stays on constantly. What must you do?  
✅ Go to a garage workshop  
❌ Take the vehicle off the road immediately  
❌ Nothing because it is an indication for the garage workshop  
**Comment**:  If the airbag indicator light is constantly illuminated while driving, the system is not ready for use. Have the  
fault rectified at the workshop.  
  
368. When should you arrange for your car to be inspected in a garage?  
✅ If you have to continuously counter-steer when driving in a straight line  
✅ If there is a permanent noise when braking  
✅ If the airbag indicator light does not switch off after the engine is started  
**Comment**:  It is not only indicator lights (e.g. AIRBAG) that provide important information about malfunctions. Repeated  
or constant noises when braking or the fact that I have to counter-steer to drive straight ahead also indicate problems: It  
is best to have them clarified in the workshop.  
  
369. In which situation is it purposeful to use an active lane change assist system?  
When overtaking on  
✅ motorways  
❌roads without markings  
✅ motorway-like roads  
**Comment**:  An active lane change assistant can carry out the entire “lane change” process automatically. However, the system  
requires well-developed roads and clear markings. It works best on highways and highway-like roads, otherwise not so much.  
  
370. The windscreen wipers do not wipe clean? What can be the reason for this?  
✅ The windscreen wiper blades are worn  
✅ There is an oil film on the windscreen  
❌ The windscreen heating is defective  
**Comment**To ensure a clear view through the windshield at all times, intact windshield wipers are essential. If they no longer wipe clean,  
the windshield wiper blades may be worn. However, there may also be a film of oil on the windshield.  
  
371. While driving, you use the adaptive cruise control (ACC). The speed is set to 100 km/h. What must you be prepared for  
before entering a bend in the road? ----IMP  
❌ The ACC will prompt me to reduce my speed  
✅ I have to adjust my speed to the situation  
✅ The ACC may cause my vehicle to accelerate  
**Comment**:  Assistance systems are not autonomous driving systems, they usually only take on partial tasks. An adaptive cruise  
control system (AGR, symbol in the display) can keep a previously set speed constant and adapt to slower vehicles in front of me,  
for example. However, the system does not necessarily recognize the course of the road. According to the speedometer, my speed is  
initially set to 100 km/h, but because of the slower vehicle in front of me, the AGR reduces the speed to 70 km/h before the bend. 
On the bend, the brake lights on the vehicle in front light up briefly, then it disappears behind the bend and the road seems 
clear. Therefore, the AGR could now automatically accelerate back to 100 km/h in the bend of all places, too fast for this bend: 
I have to actively override the system and adjust my speed myself. TIP: Watch the movie several times and pay attention to the 
actions of others!  
  
372. What is the meaning of the date of manufacture "1217" specified on the tyre?  
The tyre was  
❌ manufactured on the 1/2/2017  
❌ manufactured in the 12th month (December) of the year 2017  
✅ manufactured in 12th calendar week of the year 2017  
**Comment**:  The date of manufacture is applied to the vehicle tires in “coded” form: the first two digits stand for the  
calendar week, the last two for the year. “1419”, for example, means 14th week 2019.  
  
373. When should you check the tyre pressure?  
✅ Regularly when the tyres are cool  
Directly after every journey  
✅ Directly after a tyre change  
**Comment**:  The tire pressure should be measured at least once a week when the tires are cold. The measurement result would be  
falsified if the tires were warm. The pressure in warm tires rises and is therefore higher than the target value. The tire pressure   
must be checked immediately after every tire change, as the tire pressure of the spare wheel will generally not match the target  
value.  
  
374. What should I be aware of when using an adaptive cruise control system?  
✅ I must remain constantly attentive even when using the system for a longer period  
✅ The system can be affected by heavy rain or snow fall  
✅ Activating the accelerator or brake pedal can always override the system  
**Comment**:  Every assistance system only offers auxiliary functions. The person in the driver's seat remains responsible.  
Especially in the event of a malfunction (e.g. due to dirt, snow or a defect), it may be necessary to “override” the system  
by using the accelerator or brake pedal! I must therefore remain attentive.  
  
375. The automatic lighting system is activated on your car. What should you anticipate when driving in the lighting conditions shown?  
✅ The low beam does not turn on automatically  
✅ I will only be seen very late by the road users behind me  
❌ The automatic lighting system will switch on my fog lights  
**Comment**:  Driver assistance systems (DAS) and comfort functions such as an automatic light system are not yet 100% reliable. 
Under certain circumstances, especially in fog and twilight, the dipped headlights, for example, do not switch on automatically. 
As a result, I may be seen later than usual by following road users. This is because the rear lights remain switched off when 
driving with daytime running lights. In such cases, I have to switch on the low beam and fog lights manually myself.  
  
376. How can you prevent a child from opening a door while the vehicle is moving?right  
I activate  
❌ the central locking system  
✅ the child safety locks on the rear doors  
**Comment**:  If I activate the child locks on the rear doors before driving, children cannot open them from the inside. This 
gives me more security while driving.  
  
377. Your motor vehicle is equipped with a lane change assist system without steering intervention. While driving, the warning  
light flashes on the left-hand exterior rear-view mirror. What is this warning light indicating?  
✅ You may not now perform a lane change to the left  
❌ You can now perform a lane change to the left without any risk  
✅ Another vehicle is located within the monitored area  
**Comment**:  A lane change assistant without steering intervention can only warn, not intervene. The responsibility lies with me. 
I have to pay attention to the warning signs before changing lanes and, if necessary, follow them. The warning light indicates a 
vehicle in the blind spot, so I'm not allowed to change lanes now.  
  
378. What is the main function of the headrest in a car?  
The head rest  
❌ improves the seating position  
❌ replaces the seatbelt in the rear seats  
✅ enhances safety for the occupants  
**Comment**:  Head restraints prevent injuries to the cervical spine (“whiplash”) in the event of a rear-end collision. This  
increases the safety of people traveling with you. For headrests to be effective, it is important to adjust them correctly.  
Headrests cannot replace seat belts. They must always be created.  
  
379. What should you note regarding the trailer coupling, when transporting pedelecs on a rear-mounted carrier system?  
In view of the heavy weight of the pedelecs  
✅ the car’s tyre inflation pressure must be adjusted appropriately  
✅ the rear-mounted carrier system must be suitably designed  
✅ the trailer coupling must have a suitable vertical load capacity  
**Comment**:  Bicycles with electric drives and batteries (also: Pedelcs) are heavier than others. When transporting with a rear 
carrying system on a car: 1. the system must be suitable / 2. the support load of the trailer hitch must be sufficient / 3. the 
tire inflation pressure of the car must be adjusted accordingly if necessary.  
  
380. What is the function of engine oil in a combustion engine?  
Engine oil boosts  
✅ cleaning  
✅ cooling  
✅ wear protection  
**Comment**:  The lubrication system transports the engine oil to components that rub against each other. The oil film protects  
e.g. B. pistons and cylinders from wear and at the same time serves to clean and cool the components. Engine oil prevents pistons   
and bearings from seizing.  
  
381. While driving, the inside of your vehicle’s windscreen begins to mist over. How can you counteract this?  
✅ By turning on the climate control system  
❌ By opening the window if the outdoor humidity level is high  
✅ By directing the airflow onto the windscreen at full power  
**Comment**:   
Switching on the ventilation at the highest level (MAX mode) and the air conditioning can help prevent the vehicle's windshield  
from fogging up after just a short time. Opening the windows, on the other hand, helps little to nothing, especially not when  
the outside air humidity is high.  
  
382. How must a load be marked in darkness or bad visibility when it extends laterally more than 40 cm beyond the side lights of the vehicle?  
✅ By a red light to the back  
✅ By a white light to the front  
❌ By switching on the hazard warning lights  
**Comment**:   
Other road users must be able to see cargo that protrudes more than 40cm beyond the side lights, even in poor visibility. It is 
therefore mandatory that this load is identified at the front by white light and at the rear by red light.  
  
383. What can interfere with your view?  
✅ Smeared windows  
✅ Worn wiper blades (formation of streaks)  
✅ The load  
**Comment**:  Good all-round visibility is an important prerequisite for proactive and safe driving. Loads or dirty windows as a 
result of worn wiper blades can impair visibility. Ensure a clear view immediately.  
  
384. The lane keeping assist system warns you with acoustic, haptic or optical signals. What might be the cause of this?  
❌ Another vehicle is overtaking me with not enough side clearance  
✅ My vehicle is getting close to the road markings at the side of the road  
❌ My vehicle is undercutting the safety distance to the vehicle ahead  
**Comment**:  Assistance systems are highly specialized. If the lane departure warning system becomes noticeable, it has 
probably detected a driving error, e.g. B. if I drive too close to the lane markings on the side. Other systems are responsible 
for distances to other vehicles, e.g. B. a distance warning assistant.  
  
385. What is caused by driving with winter tyres during the summer months?  
It increases  
✅ the fuel consumption  
✅ tyre wear  
❌ driving stability  
**Comment**:  Winter tires are optimized for the cold season. In summer they wear out more quickly and their nature means they consume more fuel  
  
386.What inhibits the operation of a three-point seatbelt?  
✅ Not fully locking the belt into the harness buckle  
✅ Passing the belt under both arms  
✅ Wearing a thick winter coat  
**Comment**:  To be fully effective, seat belts must be worn correctly. Wearing a thick winter jacket or running the belt under both 
arms severely limits its function. Not fully engaging the belt buckle is also an avoidable safety problem! 
  
387. What must you do when transporting bicycles on the roof of your car?  
✅ Safely attach holding device and bicycles  
✅ Regularly check the fixing devices  
✅ Avoid driving at high speed  
**Comment**:  Anyone who transports bicycles must ensure that other road users are not endangered. Make sure the holding device and  
the bicycles are securely fastened. The fastening must be checked regularly. If bicycles are transported on the roof, the driving  
characteristics deteriorate due to the increased center of gravity. Therefore, high speeds should be avoided.  
  
388. A lane assist system with corrective steer control can help you when driving. What should you be aware of?  
A lane assist system with corrective steer control can  
✅ keep the vehicle in lane if the road markings are clear  
✅ not function if the road markings are poor  
❌ compensate for a lack of fitness to drive (e.g. tiredness)  
**Comment**:  The lane keeping assistant only works reliably if the road markings are clearly visible. Weather influences, dirty  
markings and construction sites with yellow and white markings can cause problems!  
  
389. The cruise control system of your motor vehicle is set to 130 km/h. What is the right course of action now?  
I have to  
❌ move to the right-hand lane  
✅ restore the safety distance by braking  
❌ overtake the motorbike  
**Comment**:  The “simple” cruise control system “cruise control” can maintain the speed, but cannot detect external changes 
(e.g. vehicles ahead slowing down). As a driver, I am responsible for this. I switch off the default setting by braking or 
accelerating.  
  
390. When you press on the brake pedal, it touches the floor. Only when you press on it several times does the pedal travel become shorter. What must you do?  
❌ It is sufficient to fill up the brake fluid  
✅ Park the car immediately  
✅ Have the brakes repaired  
**Comment**:  When testing the brakes while stationary, you will feel resistance about a third of the way through the pedal  
travel: the raking effect begins. After a maximum of two thirds of the full travel of the pedal, the pedal must no longer  
give way. If the pedal travel is too long and only becomes shorter after repeated pedaling, there is air in the brake system.  
Since sufficient braking power is not possible, you are no longer allowed to drive the vehicle. Stop the vehicle immediately  
and have the brake repaired.  
  
391. Where can you stow your baggage so that you do not increase your fuel consumption unnecessarily?  
✅ Behind the front seats  
❌ On the roof-rack  
✅ In the boot  
**Comment**:  Loading on the roof increases air resistance and fuel consumption. Therefore, if possible, luggage should be stored  
in the trunk or behind the front seats.  
  
392. How can driver assistance systems be helpful?  
❌ To compensate for unfitness to drive  
✅ In increasing road safety  
✅ In assisting the driver  
**Comment**:  Each assistance system only offers auxiliary functions. The person in the driver's seat remains responsible. If used 
consciously, the technology can relieve the driver and increase road safety. But it cannot replace him.  
  
393. In what situation can the lane keep assist system with steering override help you?  
When driving  
✅ on rural roads  
✅ on motorways  
❌ in constricted roadworks sites with poor road markings  
**Comment**:  The Lane Keeping Assist offers good support when driving on country roads or motorways. Under special circumstances  
(e.g. dirty road surfaces or poor road markings), an assistance system's function may be restricted. Then I have to take over all  
the tasks myself again.  
  
394. When planning your journeys, how can you make them environmentally-friendlier?  
By  
✅ combining several destinations into one single trip  
✅ forming car pools with other vehicle users  
✅ planning to use public transport instead of my own vehicle  
**Comment**: The best way to plan my trips in an environmentally friendly way is to combine several destinations into one trip,  
carpool with others (e.g. colleagues) or use public transport (bus or train).  
  
395. You want to overtake and you have initiated a lane change using the active lane change assist system. What is correct?right  
✅ The systems independently performs the lane change  
✅ I have to monitor the lane change  
✅ The system always maintains all safety distances independently  
**Comment**:  An active lane change assistant can carry out the entire lane change process automatically. As the responsible  
driver, I have to monitor lane changes and take corrective action if necessary, for example to prevent a collision. The system  
can e.g. It does NOT ALWAYS all safety distances can be reliably maintained  
  
396. What is the minimum distance you must leave clear when parking outside a built-up area before a St. Andrew's Cross?  
Answer: 50 m  
**Comment**:  Outside town, you are not allowed to park within 50m of a St. Andrew's Cross.  
  
397. Where must you use a parking disc for parking?  
❌ In a no-waiting area  
✅ Where stipulated by traffic signs  
✅ At a defective parking meter  
**Comment**:  To ensure that as many drivers as possible can use the limited parking space, parking times are limited in many places.  
For this purpose, parking meters or parking ticket machines are set up or a traffic sign states that you must use a parking disc.  
If the parking meter or parking ticket machine is defective, you must also use the parking disc to indicate the start of the  
parking time. The maximum permitted parking time must not be exceeded.  
  
398. The time on a parking meter has not yet run out. What do you do?  
You may  
❌ not use the time left on the meter  
❌ only use the time left on the meter when using a parking disc  
✅ use the time left on the meter without inserting more money  
**Comment**: It is permissible to use the remaining parking time of the predecessor. If you do not exceed this remaining parking time,  
you do not have to use the parking meter.  
  
399. Who is parked?  
✅ Anyone who leaves his vehicle  
❌ Anyone who waits longer than 3 minutes at a closed level crossing barrier  
✅ Anyone who stops for more than 3 minutes  
**Comment**: Anyone who leaves their vehicle or stops for more than 3 minutes is parking.  
  
400. You are looking for somewhere to park on the right edge of the street. There is no cycle path to the right of your lane. ----IMP  
How many metres before and after a junction are you not allowed to park?  
✅ _5m_  
**Comment**: StVO: “Parking is not permitted in front of and behind intersections and junctions up to 5 m from the intersection  
of the road edges.” If there is a cycle path to the right of the road in the direction of travel, I am not even allowed to park  
up to 8 m in front of an intersection/junction park.  
  
401. What is allowed on priority roads outside built-up areas? ---- IMP  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_104.jpg)  
✅ Parking on the hard shoulder  
❌ Parking on the roadway  
✅ Stopping on the right edge of the roadway  
**Comment**On priority roads outside built-up areas, stopping on the right side of the road and parking only on the shoulder 
is permitted. Parking on the road is expressly prohibited.  
  
402. During twilight or the hours of darkness, when must you have your side lights switched on as a minimum requirement?  
❌ When driving on roads with adequate continuous lighting  
✅ When the vehicle is parked on the hard shoulder outside built-up areas  
**Comment**:  In order for a vehicle parked on the side of the road or on the shoulder to be noticed in good time in the dark,  
it must be sufficiently illuminated. If the vehicle is parked on the road outside built-up areas, the parking light is no longer 
sufficient; the parking lights must be switched on.  
  
403. You experience a breakdown outside of a built-up area. Your car is situated on the carriageway, behind a bend in the road.  
Which is correct in this situation?  
✅ I have to place at least one well-visible warning sign about 100 m behind the vehicle  
✅ I have to switch on my hazard lights  
✅ I should wear a hi-vis vest  
  
404. Up to which permissible total mass may motor vehicles be parked on specially designated footpaths? __2.8 tonnes__  
  
405. Before which sign must you maintain a distance of at least 10 m, if it would otherwise be concealed by your vehicle?  ---IMP  
✅ Stop. Give way.  
❌ No stopping  
✅ Diagonal cross  
Comment :Important traffic signs such as the St. Andrew's Cross (Also known as St. Andrew Cross )or "Stop. Give way." and  
traffic lights must always be visible in good time. That's why you shouldn't cover them with the vehicle when stopping.  
To ensure a clear view of the sign, you must maintain a distance of at least 10 m from the traffic sign.  
  
406. Where are you allowed to park a trailer with a permissible total mass exceeding 2 t in built-up areas regularly on  
sundays and public holidays and between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.?  
✅ In wholly residential areas, on specially designated parking spaces  
❌ In special areas reserved for recreation purposes, on sufficiently wide roads  
✅ In industrial areas  
**Comment**:  Trailers with a permissible total mass of over 2 tonnes are allowed to park regularly in commercial areas and  
in appropriately marked parking spaces in residential areas, including on Sundays and public holidays and between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  
  
407.You want to let a child out of your car. What should you be aware of when doing so?right  
The child should  
✅ be warned of possible dangers when getting out of the car  
✅ exit the car on the same side as the footpath  
✅ not have to cross over the carriageway  
  
408. When are you not allowed to park on the right-hand lane?  
✅ If there is a suitable parking lane to the right of the road lane  
✅ If there is an adequately paved hard shoulder to the right of the road lane  
✅ If there are rails integrated into the road lane  
**Comment**:  Normally I can park on the right side of the road. However, it is prohibited if there are tracks there or if  
there is a shoulder suitable for parking or a usable parking lane to the right of them.  
  
409. What is the minimum distance a vehicle must leave clear in front of traffic lights if the traffic lights would be   
concealed by the vehicle? --- IMP  
__10m__  
**Comment**: Traffic lights must always be visible in good time. That's why you shouldn't cover them with the vehicle  
when stopping. If this is the case, you must maintain a distance of at least 10m from the traffic lights.  
  
410. Your car is standing on the edge of the roadway. What should you do when getting into the car?  
❌ The doors on the right-hand side can always be opened without danger  
✅ Let passengers get into the car, if possible, from the pavement  
✅ Open the doors on the roadway side only when traffic permits  
**Comment**: In order not to endanger the flow of traffic on the street, passengers should, if possible,  
get in on the side of the sidewalk. If you get in on the side of the road, you should only open the doors when traffic permits.  
  
411. Your car suffers a flat tyre on the motorway. What should you do?  
I have to  
✅ turn on my hazard lights and park as far to the right as possible  
✅ place the warning triangle at a distance of about 100 m  
❌ continue driving to the next exit  
  
412. You want to park on the right-hand side edge of the carriageway. How big is the mandatory minimum distance between your  
vehicle and the solid lane boundary line? __3m__  
**Comment**:  The distance between the lane boundary and the parked vehicle must be at least 3 m. This means that traffic that is   
not allowed to cross the lane boundary can drive past my vehicle unhindered.  
  
413. Your car has an engine fault and must be towed away with a tow rope. What must you be aware of?  
❌ Driving licence class BE is the minimum required in order to tow a car  
✅ A malfunctioning car with assisted steering is difficult to steer  
✅ When towing an electric vehicle, it is necessary to following the manufacturer’s guidelines  
**Comment**:  There are a few things to consider when towing. A steering aid (power steering) only works when the engine is  
running. If the engine fails, steering becomes difficult. Special conditions apply to electric vehicles: Always follow the  
manufacturer's instructions  
  
414. Where is parking prohibited?  
❌ On priority roads within built-up areas  
✅ At the edge of the roadway if this would prevent others from using designated parking areas  
✅ On priority roads outside built-up areas  
**Comment**:  Anyone who leaves their vehicle or stops for longer than 3 minutes is parking. Parking is not permitted everywhere.  
For example, it is prohibited on the edge of the road if this prevents the use of marked parking spaces. It is also prohibited  
on the carriageway of priority roads outside built-up areas.  
  
415. You are looking for a place to park on the right edge of the carriageway. A cycle path runs alongside to the right of the carriageway. How many metres before a junction or an intersection are you prohibited from parking?  
__8m__  
**Comment**:  StVO: Parking is not permitted in front of intersections and junctions up to 8 m from the intersection of the edges  
of the  carriageway, provided that a cycle path has been constructed to the right of the carriageway in the direction of travel  
(Section 12 (3)). This regulation is intended to increase the visibility and safety of cyclists.  
  
416. Where is stopping prohibited?  
✅ On the roadway, if there is a sufficiently wide hard shoulder on the right  
✅ At taxi ranks  
✅ Between lane dividers when direction arrows are marked on the roadway  
**Comment**: Stopping is a voluntary interruption of the journey that is not caused by the traffic situation or an order.  
Stopping is prohibited where the “No stopping” sign prescribes it. Stopping is also prohibited on marked lanes with  
directional arrows, at cab ranks and on the carriageway if there is a suitable hard shoulder on the right.  
  
417. Where is it forbidden to stop?  
✅ On merging and demerging lanes  
❌ In front of entrances to and exits from property lots  
✅ On lanes marked with direction arrows  
**Comment**: Stopping is always prohibited if the stopping vehicle creates a hazard or obstruction, e.g. on merging and merging  
lanes or on marked lanes with directional arrows.  
  
418. Where is stopping prohibited?  
✅ On level crossings  
❌ Immediately behind pedestrian crossings  
✅ On narrow sections of the road and at blind spots  
**Comment**:  Stopping is a voluntary interruption of the journey that is not caused by the traffic situation or an order.  
Stopping is prohibited where the traffic sign “No stopping” prescribes it and in places where stopping can be dangerous,  
e.g. on narrow and confusing roads and at level crossings.  
  
419. Who has stopped incorrectly?    
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_12_126_1.jpg)  
❌ Both cars  
✅ The blue van  
❌ The green car  
**Comment**:  Parked vehicles can make it difficult to see pedestrians: Stopping on and up to 5 m in front of crosswalks is not 
permitted. The vehicle in front of the crosswalk stops incorrectly!  
  
420. Where is it forbidden to stop?  
❌ In non-parking zones  
✅ In front of fire service access roads  
❌ On any one-way road  
**Comment**:  StVO: “Stopping is not permitted in front of and in officially marked fire lanes.” In one-way streets, on the other  
hand, there are often places to stop and park. I may not be allowed to PARK in no-parking zones, but STOPPING is not generally  
prohibited there.  
  
421. What must you remember when parking a trailer without a truck?  
The trailer  
❌ may be parked for an unlimited period of time on adequate hard shoulders  
✅ may not be parked for more than 2 weeks on public roads  
✅ may be parked for more than 2 weeks on specially designated parking spaces  
**Comment**:  Trailers without a towing vehicle may be parked on public roads for up to 2 weeks. You may only park for longer than two  
weeks in appropriately marked parking spaces.  
  
422. You want to park in a car park where there is a parking-ticket machine. What must you remember?  
✅ Place a valid parking ticket in your vehicle so it is easy to read from outside  
✅ Do not exceed the parking time indicated on the parking ticket  
❌ A parking ticket is never needed when using a parking disc  
**Comment**:  In the area of parking ticket machines, parking is only permitted with a parking ticket and only for the specified   
period of time. Attach the parking ticket clearly legible on or in the vehicle, e.g. behind the windshield.  
  
423. A car with power steering has broken down with engine damage and must be towed away. What is correct? ----IMP  
The steering of the broken down car  
✅ is considerably heavier  
❌ is not impaired  
❌ is locked  
**Comment**:  The power steering assistance only works when the engine is running. The steering assistance fails in the event of   
engine damage. When towing, remember that the steering of the broken-down vehicle is heavier.  
  
424. Where is parking prohibited?  
❌ Immediately behind pedestrian crossings  
✅ At taxi ranks  
✅ On narrow roadways opposite driveway entrances and exits  
**Comment**:  Property exits must not be blocked. Parking is therefore prohibited there, and on narrow streets also opposite.  
Cab ranks are reserved for cabs. The cab rank sign includes the “No stopping” traffic sign. It is not permitted to stop or park there.  
  
425. How do you secure a car with a manual gearbox against rolling away on a downhill slope?  
✅ Apply the parking brake  
✅ Engage first gear or reverse gear  
❌ Put the gear lever in neutral position  
**Comment**:  A car parked on a hill must be secured against rolling away. For vehicles with manual transmission,  
apply the parking brake (handbrake) and engage first gear or reverse gear.  
  
426. At 10.40, you enter an area where parking is allowed for 2 hours when using a parking disc. What time must you set on   
the parking disc?  
❌ 13.00  
✅ 11.00  
❌ 12.40  
**Comment**:  The parking disk is set so that the pointer points to the half-hour mark following the time of arrival. This means   
that 11 o'clock must be set here. Make sure that the parking disk is easy to read from the outside.  
  
427. You have stopped in a parking strip and now want to exit your vehicle. What must you do in this situation?  
I observe the traffic approaching from the rear  
✅ by looking in my left-hand exterior rear-view mirror before opening the door  
❌ just by looking through the slightly opened door  
✅ by glancing over my left shoulder before opening the door  
**Comment**:  If you want to get out of the vehicle, you must not endanger moving traffic (including cyclists) and pedestrians.  
After stopping, I first look in the wing mirror . Before opening the door, I look over my shoulder to make sure that nobody  
is behind or next to the car. A carelessly opened door can cause an accident. Therefore, make sure you are safe before opening  
the door! If necessary, remind passengers to act carefully before getting out of the car.  
  
428. You car has a fault and can no longer be driven. What must you be aware of during towing?  
During towing  
✅ the hazard lights must be switched on on both vehicles  
✅ the towing cable should be kept as taut as possible  
❌ the motorway may only be used to shorten the journey to the next car garage  
**Comment**:  Note when towing: The journey may only go as far as the nearest suitable workshop, leave the highway at the next exit,  
hazard warning lights must be switched on in both vehicles. Drive slowly and make sure that the rope remains taut.  
  
429. You car has a fault and can no longer be driven. What must you be aware of during towing?  
During towing  
✅ a towing bar should be used where possible  
❌ the rear fog lights should also be switched on to indicate the towing procedure  
✅ the force required to operate the brake pedal is significantly greater if the engine has failed  
**Comment**:  If the engine fails due to a defect, the power steering and brake booster no longer work and the braking effect  
is only slight - even with increased pedal pressure. If possible, use a tow bar for towing in such a case. It keeps the distance   
between the two vehicles constant.  
  
430. Where is it sufficient to use your parking lights while your car is parked on an unlit roadway?  
✅ In built-up areas  
❌ Outside built-up areas  
❌ On the hard shoulder of autobahns  
**Comment**:  Parked vehicles must be clearly visible in the dark so that other vehicles can safely avoid them. If there is  
insufficient street lighting, you must use your own lighting sources, for example parking lights or parking lights. As the  
light from parking lights does not reach far, parking lights may only be used within built-up areas.  
  
431. You want to park in front of a St. Andrew's Cross in a built-up area. What is the minimum distance you must leave clear?  
Answer: 5m  
**Comment**:  In urban areas, you are not allowed to park up to 5m in front of a St. Andrew's cross.  
  
432. Where is stopping prohibited?  
✅ Outside parking areas on autobahns and clearways for motor vehicles only  
✅ Near or on sharp bends  
❌ At bus stops  
**Comment**:  Stopping bans serve the flow and safety of traffic. For this reason, it is not permitted to stop on highways and motorways  
outside of parking spaces and around sharp bends.  
  
433. What must you remember when towing?  
✅ The distance between the vehicles must not exceed 5 m  
❌ Motorcycles may only be towed with a fixed connection  
✅ Tow-rope/tow-bar must be clearly marked  
**Comment**:  A tow rope or tow bar is difficult for other road users to see. You must therefore mark the rope or tow bar, e.g. with 
a red cloth. In this way, other road users, e.g. pedestrians who want to cross the road between the two vehicles, are visually warned. 
A small distance between the towing and towed vehicle - maximum 5m - supports this precautionary measure.  
  
434. What is the maximum length of time you are allowed to stop at a bus stop provided you do not present an obstruction to buses?  
Answer: 3 minutes  
  
435. Where may you park here?  
In my direction of travel  
❌ on the right-hand hard shoulder only  
❌ on the left-hand hard shoulder only  
✅ on the left and right-hand hard shoulders  
**Comment**:  Parking is permitted on both sides of streets with only one direction of travel (one-way streets), in this case on the 
left and right-hand hard shoulder.  
  
436. Where is stopping prohibited?  ----IMP  
✅ On pedestrian crossings and up to 5 m before pedestrian crossings  
❌ Over manholes and other road covers  
❌ Immediately behind pedestrian crossings  
**Comment**:  Stopping is a voluntary interruption of the journey that is not caused by the traffic situation or an order.  
Stopping is prohibited where the “No stopping” sign prescribes it. Stopping is also prohibited on crosswalks and up to 5 m 
in front of them.  
  
437. What does it mean when the flashing blue light of a vehicle is switched on but not the siren?  
❌ A breakdown vehicle is on duty and on its way to its destination  
✅ Warning of fire-brigade in action  
✅ Warning of an accident or other dangers  
**Comment**:  Blue flashing light without emergency horn warns at accident sites or other police, fire department and other emergency sites.  
  
438. What is the right course of action now?  
I stop, switch off the engine and  
❌ wait in the vehicle for the scene of the accident to be cleared  
✅ exit the tunnel via the emergency exit  
✅ leave the ignition key or transponder behind when leaving the vehicle  
**Comment**:  In the event of an accident with smoke in the tunnel, the following emergency rules apply: Immediately switch on the hazard  
warning lights, pull over to the side of the road or into a lay-by and switch off the engine. Leave the ignition key in the ignition  
(so that helpers can move the vehicle if necessary) and leave the vehicle. Look for the nearest escape route or emergency exit and,  
if necessary, activate the fire alarm at the nearest emergency call station.  
  
439. What do you do in case of a breakdown in a tunnel?right  
❌ Let the engine run by way of precaution  
✅ Switch on the hazard warning lights  
✅ If possible, park the vehicle in an emergency bay  
**Comment**:  In the event of a breakdown, switch on the hazard warning lights immediately and try to reach a breakdown bay where your vehicle  
is relatively safe (otherwise park on the hard shoulder or on the far right-hand side of the road). Switch off the engine, get out to the  
right if possible and call for help on the emergency telephone.  
  
440. While driving in a tunnel you were forced to bring your vehicle to a halt due to a fire. What should you do now?  
✅ I trigger the fire alarm at the emergency call point  
✅ I extinguish the fire as best I can  
❌ I lock my vehicle  
**Comment**:  If your vehicle catches fire in the tunnel, stop the vehicle with hazard warning lights flashing and trigger the fire alarm at the  
emergency call station. If possible, extinguish the fire yourself, e.g. with a fire extinguisher from the emergency call station. Do not  
lock the vehicle, leave the ignition key in the ignition.  
  
441. As a basic rule, what lights of a motor vehicle must be turned on when driving in darkness?  
❌ The driving beam  
✅ The dipped headlight  
❌ Only the parking light  
**Comment**:  STANDING lights alone are not sufficient for DRIVING in the dark, as the name suggests. To be able to see and be seen in the dark,  
you have to switch on the low beam.  
  
442. When driving, what can cause you to miss warning signals?  
❌ Driving at a low engine speed  
✅ Listening to loud music  
✅ Becoming distracting during a telephone call  
**Comment**:  Drivers are responsible for ensuring that they can hear relevant traffic signals at all times. Loud music or  
intensive phone calls can lead to the siren or other warning signals being ignored, for example. This does not include  
driving at low engine speed, as the engine is comparatively quiet in the low speed range.  
  
443. What must you do now?  
I continue driving on my lane  
✅ as far to the right as possible  
❌ as far to the left as possible  
❌ in the centre  
**Comment**:  Traffic jam on the 3-lane highway. I switch on the hazard warning lights. An emergency vehicle is approaching from  
behind (rear-view mirror). The vehicles in the two left-hand lanes have to form an emergency lane, so I have to drive as far to  
the right as possible! TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to slowing down and hazard lights!  
  
444. What should you do in this kind of visibility? (Main beam light on by the oncoming traffic)  
❌ I switch on my main beam lights  
✅ I keep towards the right-hand edge of the carriageway  
✅ I reduce my speed  
**Comment**:  If an oncoming vehicle dazzles me, I don't look at its headlights, but look to the right-hand side of the road. If necessary, I slow down.  
  
445. You are driving on a road with one lane for each direction. A convoy of motor vehicles is driving up ahead of you.  
Why should you refrain from overtaking in order to prevent a dangerous situation from occurring?  
✅ Because I should not break the convoy by pulling back into my lane early  
✅ Because the overtaking distance is considerably larger than with single vehicles  
✅ Because I cannot assess the road traffic situation ahead of the convoy  
**Comment**:  Vehicle convoys or columns, e.g. of the German Federal Armed Forces, the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW)  
or the fire department, must not be interrupted. In each case, this is a “closed formation”. I should refrain from overtaking  
because the situation is usually difficult to see and the length of the overtaking distance is very long and difficult to estimate.  
In addition, prematurely cutting in when overtaking would cause unwanted interruptions.  
  
446. You are being followed by an ambulance with its blue lights flashing and siren sounding. What should you do?  
❌ I make way immediately once the traffic light has turned green  
❌ I prompt the driver of the vehicle beside me to make way  
✅ I move out of the way immediately without endangering others  
  
447. Why should you always carry the European accident report form with you on your journey?  
Because, in the event of an accident, the European accident report form  
✅ enables the parties involved to independently document the accident  
✅ makes it easier to document the accident with foreign-speaking parties involved in the accident  
❌ unambiguously clarifies the issue of liability at the scene of the accident  
**Comment**:  In the event of a traffic accident, the standardized European Accident Report can be helpful. Not only does it  
facilitate documentation across language barriers, but - if the parties involved are in agreement - it also enables the accident  
to be recorded independently without the police. However, the parties involved cannot settle the question of liability among  
themselves - not even with forms.  
  
448. When are you allowed to use fog headlamps also during the day?  
When visibility is considerably reduced  
✅ by rain  
❌ by ice on the windscreen  
✅ by fog or falling snow  
**Comment**:  Fog lights may only be switched on if visibility is significantly impaired by rain, snowfall or fog. This also applies during the day.  
  
449. What risks could arise if you drive with your main beam lights on?  
✅ Wild animals on the road will be dazzled and will remain stationary in the light beam  
✅ Oncoming road users will be dazzled  
❌ Stationary vehicles on my side of the road will not be detected until it is too late  
**Comment**:  High beam dazzles oncoming traffic, who are then unable to see anything in time, e.g. pedestrians at the side of the  
road. If wild animals are dazzled, they remain in the light cone on the road. Therefore, dip your headlights immediately.  
  
450. What do you do in a tunnel with oncoming traffic?  
✅ Do not drive over the lane boundary markings  
✅ Do not make a U-turn  
❌ Drive over the lane boundary markings when overtaking  
**Comment**:  In tunnels with only one tube for both directions, you must never cross the lane boundary (solid line). Follow the  
right-hand lane boundary and not the center line. Do not stop, except in an emergency, and look for an emergency stop bay. Under  
no circumstances may you turn or reverse.  
  
451. What can a flashing amber light on a vehicle be a warning for?  
✅ For a large transport proceeding at low speed  
✅ For an exceptionally wide vehicle  
✅ For dangers at roadworks or the scene of an accident  
**Comment**:  Yellow flashing light warns of hazards at a work or accident site. It can also warn of vehicles with an unusual width or a slow-moving  
large goods vehicle.  
  
452. When will offences carrying two points be deleted from the Central Register of Road Traffic Offenders?  
At the earliest after  
❌2 years  
❌3 years  
✅ 5 years  
**Comment**:  Misdemeanors that are entered in the driving aptitude register (FAER) with 2 points are automatically deleted (erased) after 5 years at  
the earliest, entries with one point after 2.5 years.  
  
453. Why must you also drive with dipped headlight during the day when visibility is impaired by fog, rain or falling snow?  
✅ So that you will be more easily seen by other road users  
❌So that you can see traffic signs at greater distances  
❌So that you can drive at a higher speed  
**Comment**:  If visibility is severely impaired by fog, rain or snowfall, the daytime running lights are not sufficient to draw attention to yourself.  
With the more powerful low beam, the tail lights are also switched on, making your vehicle visible from behind.  
  
454. What can a flashing blue light (without siren) mean?  
✅ Advance warning of a closed convoy  
✅ The vehicle is on duty. You should give way  
❌Without a siren, a flashing blue light does not mean anything  
**Comment**:  Blue flashing lights alone are sometimes also used for emergency driving, but then these vehicles have no right of way. You should still  
make way for them. Blue flashing lights can also announce a closed formation, e.g. a procession or a convoy of the German armed forces.  
  
455. How can you tell the shortest way to the next emergency telephone on federal motorways?  
By the  
❌ground markings on the hard shoulder  
✅ black arrows on the delineators  
❌direction markings on the guardrails  
**Comment**:  On the highway, I can recognize the shortest route to the emergency call pillar by the next delineator. Black arrows in the upper white  
area of the delineators indicate the direction to the next emergency call pillar.  
  
456. You are involved in an accident in a carpark. The vehicle damage is minor. Everyone involved agrees that the police do not need to be informed.  
What would be helpful now for the claims process?  
✅ Describing the cause of the accident in the accident report  
✅ Exchanging the necessary details with those involved  
✅ Photographing the scene of the accident from a number of angles  
**Comment**:  As a party involved in a minor accident with minor material damage, I can agree with the others not to inform the police.  
But then I should document everything exactly, with photos from different perspectives and a description of the course of the accident  
in the accident report. This also includes exchanging the necessary personal and insurance data for the claims settlement.  
  
457. You are driving in a tunnel and approach the end of a traffic jam. What do you do?  
✅ Switch on the hazard warning lights  
❌Make a U-turn and leave the tunnel  
❌At the end of the traffic jam, switch off the engine and leave the vehicle  
**Comment**:  When approaching the end of a traffic jam, you must switch on the hazard warning lights immediately to warn those  
behind. Maintain a distance of approx. 5 m from the vehicle in front and switch off the engine if you are stationary for a longer  
period of time. Stay in the vehicle and listen to radio or loudspeaker announcements. Under no circumstances should you turn or  
reverse.  
  
458. Visibility is considerably reduced. When are you allowed to switch on fog headlamps?  
✅ In fog  
✅ In falling snow  
✅ In rain  
**Comment**:  Fog lights may only be switched on if visibility is significantly impaired by rain, snowfall or fog. This also applies 
during the day.  
  
459.What must you observe when you enter a tunnel?  
✅ Drive with dipped headlights also during the day even in well lit tunnels  
✅ Take off your sunglasses  
❌ Switch fog headlamps on  
**Comment**:  When entering a tunnel, you must always switch on the low beam, even during the day and even if the tunnel itself is well  
lit. With dipped headlights, the road is better illuminated and your car is more visible to the vehicle behind you. If necessary, take  
off your sunglasses or fold back the sun visor so as not to restrict your view.  
  
460. A vehicle driver has slightly damaged another vehicle, and unlawfully leaves the scene. What consequence could this have?  
✅ A withdrawal of the driving licence or a driving ban  
✅ An order to undergo a medical/psychological examination  
✅ A fine or imprisonment  
**Comment**:  Hit-and-run accidents result in police investigations - and are severely punished. Depending on the severity, fines or  
prison sentences, driving bans and even the ordering of a medical-psychological examination (MPU) can be considered.  
  
461. How can you get help on an autobahn?  
✅ Dial 112 or 110  
✅ Use an emergency call box  
✅ From the autobahn service areas  
**Comment**:  If you have an accident or breakdown on the highway, you can contact the police and the emergency or rescue services by  
calling 110 or 112 on your cell phone. You can also call for help at an emergency call pillar or via an emergency telephone, and on the  
highway also at service stations.  
  
462. You hear a siren. Which questions must you ask yourself?  
✅ Could I obstruct the emergency vehicle?  
❌ Is this vehicle allowed to use a siren at all?  
✅ Where is the emergency vehicle coming from?  
**Comment**:  If a special vehicle from the police or other institutions approaches with blue lights and siren, you must not obstruct   
it under any circumstances. Try to determine early on where the emergency vehicle is coming from and where it intends to go. Ask  
yourself whether you may be obstructing the vehicle and give way if necessary.  
  
463. What must you do if wild animals suddenly appear in the full beam of your headlights?  
✅ Immediately dip your headlights  
❌ Proceed on full beam  
✅ Sound the horn and brake  
**Comment**:  If game is dazzled, it often remains in the beam of light. Therefore, dip your headlights immediately, slow down and  
sound your horn if game appears in the high beam.  
  
464. There is a tunnel on my route. What should I know?  
✅ I should know how escape routes are indicated in tunnels  
❌I can be sure that help will arrive promptly in the event of emergencies  
✅ I should know how I park and leave my vehicle if I am unable to continue driving  
**Comment**:  In the event of a fire in the tunnel, there is a danger to life: pull over to the side of the road immediately, switch off the engine  
and leave your vehicle ❌leave the car keys in the ignition. Look for the nearest escape route or emergency exit and alert the tunnel monitoring  
center via the emergency call station.  
  
465. Under what emergency telephone number can you call the emergency services anywhere in Europe?right  
Answer: 112  
**Comment**:  The emergency number that is now valid throughout Europe for the rescue service or assistance, e.g. after an accident, is 112.  
If I enter the number without a prefix, I am automatically connected directly to the nearest rescue service.  
  
466. You are overtaken by a police vehicle, which pulls in immediately in front of you. The words "BITTE FOLGEN" (PLEASE FOLLOW) appear  
illuminated in red on the roof. What should you do?  
I have to  
✅ stop if the police vehicle stops  
❌allow the engine to continue running once I have stopped  
✅ follow the police vehicle  
**Comment**:  If a direct request such as “PLEASE FOLLOW” is displayed in red illuminated lettering on a patrol car, this request is directed at  
the vehicle immediately behind. In this case, I must follow the police vehicle.  
  
467. You want to continue driving straight ahead. What is correct in this situation? (repeated with other red colour( German Federal Armed Forces)  
or blue colour vehicles(Federal Agency for Technical Relief) picture)  
❌I cross over the junction  
✅ I wait at the stop line  
✅ I allow the convoy to pass through  
**Comment**:  A closed convoy (also: convoy or column) is a series of uniformly marked vehicles, e.g. from the German Federal Armed Forces,  
the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) or the fire department, which drive one behind the other. As a rule, such a convoy may  
not be interrupted. Right of way regulations do not play a role here. I must therefore wait and allow all vehicles in the formation to pass.  
  
468. Your vehicle has collided with a wild animal. What is the right course of action here?  
✅ I secure the scene of the accident  
❌I load the animal into my vehicle  
✅ I notify the police  
**Comment**:  After an accident, I must stop, switch on the hazard warning lights, put on my high-visibility vest and secure the accident site.  
This also applies after collisions with game. The police must also be informed. It is strictly forbidden to take game with you.  
  
469. You are driving with main beam lights on in darkness. When do you have to dip your headlights?right  
✅ When a vehicle is oncoming  
❌If there are pedestrians in front moving in the same direction  
✅ When a vehicle is driving close in front  
**Comment**:  In the dark, the high beam greatly extends the visible range. However, you may only use it as long as other road users are not dazzled.  
If there is oncoming traffic or if there are vehicles in front at a short distance, there is a risk of glare: you must “dip”, i.e. switch from  
high beam to low beam.  
  
470. You are driving on the autobahn. What is the correct thing to do in this situation?  
I may  
❌drive at 80 km/h maximum  
✅ drive at 50 km/h maximum  
✅ turn on the rear fog lights  
**Comment**:  The rear fog light may only be switched on if visibility through fog is less than 50 m (distance between delineator posts).  
This is the case here. When driving with rear fog light, a maximum speed limit of 50 km/h also applies.  
  
471. You are involved in an accident with another vehicle to which the following orange-coloured sign is attached.  
You see a liquid leaking from the vehicle. What is the right course of action?  
❌I attempt to block the leak in the vehicle  
✅ I provide the number of the orange-coloured sign when making the emergency call  
✅ I avoid walking in the area into which the liquid has leaked  
**Comment**:  Dangerous goods are ❌as the word suggests ❌dangerous! They can be flammable or corrosive liquids. Care must therefore be taken  
when such liquids leak. If, for example, liquid leaks after an accident, it is important to avoid contact yourself and to inform the emergency  
services so that they can prepare themselves. Under no circumstances should you attempt to seal a leak or similar yourself.  
  
472. You are involved in an accident. What document must you present to the other person involved in the accident, if requested? ---- IMP  
✅ My driving licence  
❌The liability insurance contract  
✅ The registration certificate Part I or the operating permit  
**Comment**:  After a traffic accident, everyone involved must stop immediately, secure the scene of the accident, ascertain the consequences  
of the accident and help the injured. They must inform the other parties involved of their involvement in the accident, provide personal  
details and liability insurance details and present their driving license and registration certificate part I.  
  
473. What should you do when driving through a tunnel?  
✅ In a tunnel with oncoming traffic, I position myself towards the right-hand edge of the roadway  
✅ I memorise the safety features such as emergency exits and emergency telephones  
❌I drive with a reduced distance to the vehicle ahead, so that I can use its tail lights as a guide  
**Comment**:  In tunnels with oncoming traffic, there can be dangerous light effects that dazzle or irritate. I can then orient myself quite well  
on the right-hand side of the road and on the road markings. As a precaution, I make a note of where the safety facilities such as emergency  
stop and breakdown bays, emergency telephones and emergency exits are so that I can make use of them if necessary.  
  
474. How can you tell that your main beam lights are switched on?  
By the  
❌green indicator lamp  
✅ blue indicator lamp  
❌red indicator lamp  
**Comment**:  I can tell whether the high beam is switched on by the blue indicator light (with lamp sign and three lines in horizontal position)  
A green indicator light has nothing to do with the high beam. Only warning lights actually signal a red light.  
  
475. Driving at night-time on a rural road, you see persons on your side of the road. What do you do if you are dazzled by an oncoming vehicle?  
I reduce my speed and  
✅ stop if necessary  
❌turn on my main beam lights  
✅ look towards the right-hand side of the road  
**Comment**:  If you are dazzled by oncoming traffic due to high beams, look away from the light to the right-hand side of the road. If you see  
people on your side of the road, slow down and, if necessary, stop until you can pass them safely.  
  
476. What does this traffic sign indicate? (A symbol something like a vertical trapezium where parallel sides are in vertical direction.  
It has a blue background )  
❌ A stop for breaks and changing drivers  
✅ An emergency stop and breakdown bay  
❌ A temporary additional carriageway  
**Comment**:  The traffic sign indicates an emergency stop and breakdown bay. In the event of a breakdown or emergency, you should stop 
there if possible. If you drive into the lay-by, you must expect that a vehicle is already parked there. The bay may not be used except 
in the event  of an emergency or breakdown.  
  
477. You are driving through a tunnel. What special aspect applies here?right  
In tunnels  
✅ I can be distracted by lighting effects  
✅ the safety devices, like emergency exits and emergency telephones are signposted  
✅ I can be distracted by loud vehicle noise  
**Comment**:  The unusually high noise level in tunnels can be very distracting. Light effects from tunnel and vehicle lighting can  
also be distracting. And in tunnels, safety equipment such as emergency exits and emergency telephones are signposted. So don't be  
confused by the wording in the  question: This is about SEVERAL special features.  
  
478. You are the first to arrive at the scene of the accident where there are injured people. You secure the scene of the accident and  
have gained an overview of the situation. What else do you have to do?  
I have to  
❌ document the accident  
✅ notify the emergency services  
✅ deliver first aid to the injured  
**Comment**:  Anyone who arrives at the scene of an accident first has to secure the accident site and themselves, then it's a matter  
of caring for the injured and calling for help. Others take over the documentation; I am only allowed to do this if I am involved in a   
“minor accident” (minor material damage), for example.  
  
479. In your rear-view mirror, you see the words "STOP POLIZEI" (Stop Police) in red illuminated letters on the roof of a police car  
immediately behind your car. Who does this apply to?  
❌To all vehicles on the road  
❌To all following vehicles  
✅ To you only  
**Comment**:  If “STOP POLICE” is displayed in red illuminated lettering on the roof of a patrol car, this request is directed at the  
vehicle directly in front or immediately behind. In this case, you are the vehicle directly in front, so the request only applies to  
you.  
  
480. What are you obliged to do, if you are involved in a road traffic accident?right  
I have to  
✅ stop and determine the consequences of the accident  
✅ secure the scene of the accident  
✅ provide aid if anyone has been injured  
**Comment**:  Anyone involved in a traffic accident in which people have been injured must stop and make sure of the consequences of  
the accident. I must secure myself (high-visibility vest) and the scene of the accident (e.g. warning triangle) and provide assistance  
if  someone is injured.  
  
481. A driving licence applicant practices practical driving skills without a driving instructor on public roads.  
What should he expect if the police perform a check on him?  
✅ A criminal prosecution  
✅ A review of his fitness to drive a motor vehicle  
❌No consequences provided he is accompanied in the vehicle by a holder of a driving licence  
**Comment**:  Anyone who drives a motor vehicle on public roads without a driver's license is liable to prosecution. As a driver's license  
applicant, I must then not only expect criminal proceedings, but also that doubts will arise as to my character suitability for obtaining  
a driver's license. A driving license suspension or an MPU (medical psychological examination) may be ordered for me. If the holder of  
a driving license accompanies me, this can have negative consequences for both of us.  
  
482. You have an accident on a rural road. How do you secure the scene of the accident site?  
✅ If necessary, I warn other vehicles, by using hand signals for example  
✅ I turn on my hazard lights immediately  
✅ I set up the warning triangle in a well-visible position about 100 m from the scene of the accident  
**Comment**:  To prevent subsequent accidents, the scene of the accident (fast traffic out of town) must be secured: Switch on hazard warning  
lights, put on a high-visibility vest and place the warning triangle in a clearly visible position approx. 100 m away. If necessary, warn  
other drivers, e.g. with hand signals.  
  
483. Your vehicle has damaged someone else’s parked vehicle. Despite waiting a reasonable period of time, the owner of the damaged car  
fails to appear. What is the right course of action now?  ----IMP  
I have to  
✅ report the accident to the police  
❌give my name and address to a witness not involved in the accident  
✅ leave my name and address at the scene of the accident  
**Comment**:  Anyone who does not wait a reasonable amount of time after an accident is liable to prosecution (hit-and-run). After the  
waiting period has expired, I must leave my name and address on the damaged vehicle and report the accident to the police immediately.  
Leaving your name and address alone or calling a witness is not sufficient.  
  
484. What can impair your attention when driving through a tunnel?  
✅ Reflections of light from oncoming traffic  
✅ Length of the tunnel  
❌ Good road markings  
**Comment**:  Long tunnel stretches are unfamiliar to many drivers and impair their attention due to their uniformity. Some drivers feel  
uncomfortable due to the narrowness of tunnels. Reflections from the tunnel lighting and the headlights of oncoming traffic can be  
dangerously dazzling or irritating.  
  
485. A police signalling disc is displayed towards you from a vehicle driving in front of you. What does this mean? ----IMP  
✅ I have to follow the vehicle until it stops  
✅ I may not overtake the vehicle  
❌ I have to turn in the direction indicated  
**Comment**:  Police officers may stop road users for traffic checks, including roadworthiness checks. The signal to stop can also be   
given by suitable technical equipment on the emergency vehicle or a police trowel. Road users must follow the instructions of the police   
officers.  
  
486. You are the first person to arrive at the scene of an accident with injured persons. What should you do first as a rule?  
❌ Drive to the next telephone box and call the rescue service  
✅ Make the scene of the accident safe  
❌ Check the seriousness of the injuries  
**Comment**:  If you are the first to arrive at the scene of an accident, you must slow down immediately, switch on your hazard warning   
lights and stop. If people are injured, you should put on a high-visibility vest, secure the accident site first and then administer   
first aid.  
  
487. When are you allowed to switch on rear fog lamps?  
✅ When fog reduces visibility to less than 50 m  
❌ When visibility is reduced by heavy rain  
❌ When fog reduces visibility to 100 m  
**Comment**:  The rear fog light may only be switched on if visibility through fog is less than 50 m (distance between delineator posts).  
Otherwise there is a risk of dazzling for following road users.  
  
488. You are driving with main beam lights on in darkness. When do you have to dip your headlights?  
✅ If I am driving on a road with constant, adequate lighting  
❌ If there are pedestrians moving in the same direction in front of me  
✅ If I am required to wait at a rail crossing and dazzling others  
**Comment**:  In the dark, the high beam greatly extends the visible range. However, you may only use it as long as other road users are   
not dazzled. There is a risk of dazzle when waiting in front of a level crossing: you must “dip your headlights”. If you are driving on   
a road with continuous, adequate lighting (built-up area), you must also switch off the high beam.  
  
489. How is it possible to prevent oncoming traffic being dazzled by the dipped headlights?  
✅ The headlight setting should be checked after every repair  
✅ The headlight range can be adjusted depending on the load carried by the vehicle  
✅ Only permissible light bulbs may be used in each of the headlights  
**Comment**:  Low beams can also dazzle oncoming traffic. If oncoming traffic dips up and down, it may be that my vehicle is not loaded   
correctly or the headlight range has been set incorrectly or the bulbs have not been fitted correctly when replacing them. It is best to   
have the setting checked during the light test and after every repair.  
  
490. What must you remember with regard to tyre pressure?  
✅ To increase the pressure to the level stated in the vehicle manual when the vehicle is heavily loaded  
❌ To reduce the air pressure before longer trips  
✅ To check the air pressure regularly, including that of the spare wheel  
**Comment**:  Incorrect tire pressure has a negative effect on handling, especially if the tire pressure is too low. For this reason,  
the air pressure must be checked regularly - including the spare tire, so that it is ready for use in an emergency. If the vehicle is   
heavily loaded, the air pressure must be increased. How high the air pressure must be is stated in the owner's manual and often on the   
inside of the fuel filler cap or in the door frame.  
  
491. The windscreen washer does not work. What can be the reason for this?  
✅ Defective fuse  
✅ Blocked jets  
✅ No water in the reservoir  
**Comment**:  To ensure a clear view through the windshield at all times, intact windshield wipers and a functioning windshield washer   
system are essential. If the windshield washer system is not working, there is probably no water in the reservoir or the nozzles are   
blocked. The fuse may also be defective.  
  
492. You have the lane keep assist system activated in your motor vehicle. It emits a warning signal while you are driving. What could be the cause of this?  
✅ I have unintentionally departed from my lane  
❌ I undercut the minimum distance between me and the vehicle ahead  
✅ I forgot to switch on my indicator when changing lane  
**Comment**:  Lane Keeping Assist helps me to stay in my lane with the vehicle. If the system gives a signal, I have either not indicated   
before changing lanes or have inadvertently left the lane. That is the purpose of the system. Another assistance system monitors the   
minimum distance.  
  
493. While driving, your vehicle pulls to the right. What is the right course of action?  
✅ I check the tyre inflation pressure and take the vehicle to a garage if necessary  
❌ I attempt to improve the handling by braking heavily  
❌ I simply note the steering behaviour when I continue driving  
**Comment**:  If the vehicle behaves unusually while driving, e.g. pulls to the right, this can have various causes. For my own safety, I   
should first check the tire pressure and, if necessary, have my vehicle checked at a garage.  
  
494. What could happen if the cruise control system (speed limiter) is switched off too late?  
✅ Excessively high cornering speed  
✅ Tailgating  
✅ Exceeding the permissible maximum speed  
**Comment**:  The cruise control can automatically keep a pre-selected speed constant. As the driver, I can stop this automatic function   
at any time by braking, accelerating or pressing the “off” switch. If the cruise control is switched off too late, the vehicle may enter   
a bend too quickly or drive too close. In addition, it does not automatically recognize speed limits, for example.  
  
495. You wish to take several small children home after a children's birthday party. What must you observe when using your car?  
❌ It is sufficient to secure the children with the existing safety belts  
❌ Child restraints need not be used within built-up areas  
✅ The children must be secured with the prescribed child restraints  
**Comment**:  The risk of injury is particularly high for children. Because normal seat belts do not yet “fit”, children under the age of   
12 who are smaller than 150 cm must always be secured by special restraint devices (child seats). The seat must be suitable for the   
height, weight and age of the child and officially approved. The approval can be recognized by the test mark.  
  
496. How can lane changing assist help you in this situation without steering override?   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_18_104.jpg)  
The assist  
✅ warns of a possible collision with a vehicle in the middle lane  
❌ brakes the speed of my vehicle  
❌ performs a lane change independently  
**Comment**:  Lane Change Assist only works reliably if the lane markings are clearly visible. Here, for example, it warns of a collision   
with a vehicle in the middle lane. But that's all. An independent lane change is part of autonomous driving; active braking is handled   
by another assistant, adaptive cruise control.  
  
497. What does the red symbol on the tyre indicate?   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_7_05_103.jpg)  
This tyre  
✅ is suitable for wintry weather conditions  
✅ also assists driving performance in snowy conditions  
❌ may only be used in combination with snow chains  
**Comment**Winter tires are marked with the “Alpine” symbol. They are mandatory in icy, slushy, icy or frosty conditions and support safe  
driving even in snow. They are usually only approved for certain maximum speeds. Under certain conditions, snow chains may also be   
prescribed.  
  
498. What is the impact on your vehicle if you operate the steering wheel while stationary?  
❌ Steering is made easier  
✅ A heavy strain is exerted on the front axle mechanism  
✅ The tyre tread can be damaged  
**Comment**:  When steering while stationary, the tire is worn directly under the load of the vehicle on the road.  
It also puts unnecessary strain on the mechanics of the front axle. It is better to steer when the vehicle is moving at least a little.  
  
499. What is the function of your vehicle’s emergency brake assist?  
The emergency brake assist  
✅ can reduce the risk of injury in the event of an unavoidable collision  
✅ issues warnings about the immediate risk of a rear-end collision  
❌brakes the speed of my vehicle if the event I accidentally overrun the traffic lane boundary  
**Comment**:  Many driver assistance systems are designed for road safety, some for comfort. Emergency braking can be vital for survival.  
Emergency Brake Assist therefore increases safety by warning of the immediate danger of a rear-end collision and can reduce the risk  
of injury in the event of unavoidable collisions. This assistant does not react to the accidental crossing of a lane boundary line  
(e.g. the lane departure warning system does this).  
  
500. You are driving an electric vehicle. When can recuperation inhibit the braking action?  
When driving  
✅ at less than the battery’s operating temperature  
❌in eco mode  
✅ with a fully charged battery  
**Comment**:  Recuperation recovers energy by braking when driving an electric car. If the battery is fully charged or has not yet  
reached its operating temperature, the recuperation effect may be limited. Eco mode would increase rather than reduce recuperation.  
  
501. This indicator lamp lights up. What could be the cause of this?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_7_05_107.jpg)  
✅ A recently performed wheel change  
✅ The inflation pressure is too low in one tyre  
❌A loose wheel nut  
**Comment**:  The indicator light shown symbolizes a tire and refers to the tire pressure. If it lights up, this may indicate that the  
tires have recently been changed ❌or that the tire pressure is too low. This should be rectified as soon as possible. This assistant  
cannot detect a loose wheel nut and therefore cannot warn of this.  
  
502. A display on your liquid-cooled vehicle indicates an excessively high engine temperature. What should you do now?  
❌I drive on slowly at a high engine speed to improve the engine cooling  
✅ I stop at a suitable place as quickly as possible  
❌I continue onwards in a low gear until I reach my next scheduled driving break  
**Comment**:  Indicator lights have different functions such as indicators, high beam or warning lights. Overheating of the engine can be  
very dangerous. If a temperature warning appears on the display, it is best to stop as quickly as possible in a suitable place and  
switch off the engine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for further action. If I continue driving now, whether slowly, at  
high revs or in low gear, I may risk serious engine damage. Better stop and organize help!  
  
503. Your vehicle is equipped with a hill-start assist. What benefit does this assist system provide?  
When starting on a hill, the assist system can  
❌drive all wheels simultaneously  
✅ prevent my vehicle from rolling backwards unintentionally  
✅ assume control of releasing the brakes  
**Comment**:  The term “hill start assist” refers to automated support when starting off on inclines, which prevents the vehicle from  
rolling back after stopping, even if the brake pedal is not depressed continuously. It automatically releases the brake when you  
accelerate. However, it has no influence on the drive.  
  
504. What is the permissible payload?  
✅ The maximum permissible load  
❌The permissible gross mass  
✅ The difference between the permissible gross mass and unladen mass  
**Comment**:  The maximum permissible payload is the maximum permissible payload resulting from the difference between the permissible  
gross vehicle mass (GVM) MINUS the unladen mass (LM), in short: GVM ❌LM = payload. The gross vehicle weight rating, on the other hand,  
refers to the unladen mass PLUS the load. It therefore includes unladen mass and payload.  
  
505. What can be used to secure loads carried in a car?  
✅ The luggage net  
✅ The tensioning belt  
✅ The anti-slip mat  
**Comment**:  As the driver, I am responsible for the load and familiarize myself with the available devices (safety net, lashing strap,  
anti-slip mat) before transport.  
  
506. You want to transport a load on the roof of your car. How will this influence the handling of your car?  
✅ The acceleration power will be reduced  
✅ The braking distance will be extended  
❌The susceptibility to cross-winds will be reduced  
**Comment**:  Cargo reduces acceleration performance and increases the braking distance. Cargo on the car roof increases sensitivity to  
crosswinds and must be secured with sturdy tensioning straps. The roof load specified in the operating instructions must not be  
exceeded, otherwise there is a risk of tipping.  
  
507. In what situation might your high-beam assist be unable to dim your vehicle’s high beam in good time when encountering oncoming traffic?  
✅ When driving over a summit  
✅ When driving around a bend in the road  
❌When dazzled by an oncoming vehicle  
**Comment**:  "Note the word unable" The high beam assistant automatically adjusts the high beam to the conditions. But it is not intelligent: when  
crossing a crest or on a bend, oncoming vehicles are not always detected in time. Glare from oncoming vehicles, on the other hand, should not  
interfere with detection.  
  
508. You had a tyre failure and must mount the emergency wheel. What is prohibited when you continue to drive?  
✅ Driving faster than 80 km/h  
❌Taking passengers  
✅ Driving longer than necessary with the emergency wheel  
**Comment**:  An emergency wheel is lighter and smaller than a normal wheel. If you have fitted an emergency wheel after a breakdown, the driving  
behavior changes. Therefore, you must not drive faster than 80 km/h with it. Replace the spare wheel with a full-size wheel as soon as possible.  
  
509. What load-securing equipment is to be used in the car?  
✅ Safety nets  
❌Chocks  
✅ Lashing straps  
**Comment**:  As the driver, I am responsible for the load and familiarize myself with the devices and brackets for attaching lashing straps or  
safety nets before transporting the load. (Wheel chocks are used to secure the vehicle, not the load).  
  
510. Your motor vehicle is equipped with an active lane keep assist system. What information can be indicated by the status display of this system?  
The assist system  
✅ has a fault  
✅ is deactivated  
✅ is activated  
**Comment**:  The status indicator on the display shows me whether Active Lane Keeping Assist is activated, switched off or malfunctioning.  
Otherwise, the system's interventions while driving could really startle me. The indication of a deactivation or malfunction prevents  
me from relying on a system that can't help at all.  
  
511. How does an eCall system work in the event of a serious accident?  
The eCall system automatically relays  
✅ the position of the motor vehicle  
✅ the time of the accident  
❌the severity of the injuries of the persons in the motor vehicle  
**Comment**:  The eCall system automatically transmits general vehicle data such as the location and time of the accident. It cannot record  
or pass on any data about the passengers or types of injury. This is part of the telephone emergency call.  
  
512. What should be noted regarding the desired protective effect of airbags?  
✅ The airbag deployment zone may not be encroached  
❌Airbags can replace car seatbelts when driving in town  
✅ Airbags can only achieve their full effect if the vehicle’s passengers are in the right seating position  
**Comment**:  The protective effect of airbags depends on the correct seating position of the passengers (e.g. not placing their feet on the  
dashboard) and that nothing obstructs the deployment space (e.g. rucksack or bag on the thighs). Airbags supplement the protective effect  
of seat belts, they CANNOT replace them.  
  
513. With what can a cruise control system (speed limiter) assist you?  
✅ With maintaining an energy-saving driving style  
❌With maintaining the minimum distance to the vehicle ahead  
✅ With maintaining a constant speed  
**Comment**Cruise control is the term used to describe automatic speed control that can be set to a specific value by the driver (e.g. 80 or  
120 km/h). If the vehicle drives at a constant speed, this leads to an energy-saving driving style.  
  
514. How can lane changing assist help you in this situation without steering override?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_2_18_104_1.jpg)  
The assist  
❌brakes the speed of my vehicle  
✅ warns of a possible collision with a vehicle in the middle lane  
❌performs a lane change independently  
**Comment**:  Lane Change Assist only works reliably if the lane markings are clearly visible. Here, for example, it warns of a collision with a  
vehicle in the middle lane. But that's all. An independent lane change is part of autonomous driving, active braking is handled by another  
assistant, adaptive cruise control.  
  
515. What can contribute to environmentally-friendly driving?  
✅ Attending a practical driving training session for a fuel-efficient driving style  
✅ Forming car pools  
✅ Using vehicles with an electric drive  
**Comment**:  You can learn how to protect the environment, e.g. in special driver training courses. You can also make a conscious decision to use  
an electric car or join a car pool.  
  
516. What should you anticipate when you transport a load on the roof of your car?  
The car may  
✅ tilt more to the side when cornering  
✅ have increased fuel consumption  
✅ respond more sensitively to sidewinds  
**Comment**:  When the roof is loaded, the car's center of gravity moves upwards. This has a detrimental effect on driving characteristics: the higher  
the center of gravity, the more the vehicle leans to one side when cornering. In addition, the roof load increases the sensitivity to crosswinds -  
and fuel consumption rises due to the increased air resistance.  
  
517. Why must you ensure the brake fluid is changed regularly in accordance with the vehicle manufacturer's instructions?  
✅ To prevent damage to the components of the braking system  
✅ To ensure that the braking system remains functional even under a high load  
✅ To ensure that the proportion of water in the brake fluid does not exceed the permitted level  
**Comment**:  Brake fluid absorbs water. To ensure that the water content in the brake fluid does not become too high and that the brake system remains  
functional even under high loads and no components are damaged, the brake fluid must be replaced in accordance with the vehicle manufacturer's  
instructions (usually every two years).  
  
518. What must you know about catalytic converters?  
❌Unburned fuel in the catalytic converter cannot cause any damage when the engine starts  
✅ A catalytic converter can be damaged or destroyed when the car is towed to start  
✅ A catalytic converter can be damaged when the engine starts after many unsuccessful attempts  
**Comment**:  The catalytic converter converts the pollutants in the exhaust gas into harmless chemical compounds. It can be damaged or even destroyed  
if handled incorrectly. This risk exists if the engine only starts after many unsuccessful attempts and unburned fuel enters the catalytic converter  
or if the vehicle is towed over a long distance.  
  
519.What must be remembered with regard to vehicles with canvass covers?  
✅ The canvass covers must not obstruct the driver's rear view through the outside mirrors  
✅ Unloaded trailers with high canvass cover superstructure are particularly sensitive to side wind  
❌When vehicles have canvass covers, a load must not be specially secured  
**Comment**:  As the driver, you are responsible for the safety of the vehicle. This also includes visibility to the rear. If it is not possible to see  
through the rear window, e.g. because of a trailer with a tarpaulin, visibility to the rear must be guaranteed via the exterior mirrors.  
The tarpaulins must therefore not obstruct the view via the exterior mirrors. Unladen trailers with high tarpaulin bodies are also particularly  
sensitive to side winds.  
  
520. The indicator lamp of your car’s Electronic Stability Program (ESC) is continuously illuminated. What might this indicate?right  
The Electronic Stability Program (ESC)  
✅ has been deactivated  
✅ is defective  
❌is switched on  
**Comment**:  If an indicator light in the car is permanently illuminated, this usually indicates deactivation or a DEFECT. This also applies to the  
Electronic Stability Control (ESC). If it is active, this is indicated by a brief flash, not by a continuous light.  
  
521. Under what conditions can an active lane change assist system perform a lane change?  
If the system  
❌has detected a sufficiently large gap in the oncoming traffic  
✅ has not detected any vehicles in the relevant safety zone  
✅ has detected an adequately marked carriageway with multiple lanes  
**Comment**:  There are two important prerequisites for using Active Lane Change Assist: 1. the lane on which the car is located must have two or  
more clearly marked lanes (e.g. highway). 2. the system must not have detected any other vehicles in the area relevant for a safe lane change -  
otherwise it will stop the process. The system cannot detect gaps in oncoming traffic  
  
522. What should be noted when loading vehicles?  
✅ Loads that project beyond the retro-reflectors by more than 1 m, must be labelled  
✅ Loads more than 2.50 m high may not project forwards by more than 50 cm  
❌It is not necessary to secure heavy loads  
**Comment**:  To ensure that other road users (e.g. cyclists, vehicles in front) are not endangered, the load may only protrude forwards from a  
height of 2.50 m or more. And even then only a maximum of 50 cm. If the load protrudes more than 1 meter beyond the rear reflectors, it must  
be made visible to following vehicles.  
  
523. When accelerating, you notice that the steering wheel trembles. How should you do here? ----IMP  
I check the  
✅ front wheels for damage  
✅ mounting of the front wheels  
❌steering wheel mounting  
**Comment**:  The steering wheel does not really “flutter”, but the word describes an unclear “shaking” or “jerking” of the steering wheel when driving,  
which can indicate damage or faulty attachment of the front wheels. This has nothing to do with the steering wheel mounting and should always be  
taken seriously!  
  
524. You have left your registered caravan trailer for six months during the winter on a campground. What applies as far as the official  
inspection (Hauptuntersuchung) is concerned?  
✅ The date indicated on the test stamp must be observed  
❌The date indicated on the test stamp is extended by the time the caravan was stationary on the campground  
**Comment**:  Caravans are also checked for technical safety at regular intervals and ❌if everything is in order ❌are then given an inspection  
sticker indicating the month and year of the next main inspection due. This date must be adhered to. This also applies if the date is in winter  
or the caravan is parked on a campsite.  
  
525. What is the purpose of an adaptive cruise control system (ACC) in motor vehicles?  
The system  
✅ independently slows the vehicle if it identifies a vehicle ahead travelling at a lower speed  
❌always maintains the prescribed safety distance to the vehicle ahead  
✅ independently accelerates the vehicle until it reaches a previously set speed  
**Comment**:  Every assistance system only offers auxiliary functions. The person in the driver's seat remains responsible. Adaptive cruise control  
accelerates automatically to the previously set speed and brakes automatically if, for example, the vehicle in front is slower. However, as the  
driver, I am still responsible for maintaining a safe distance. If necessary, I have to intervene.  
  
526. A display on your liquid-cooled vehicle indicates that the temperature of your coolant is excessively high. What might be the cause of this?  
✅ The radiator fan has stopped working  
✅ There is a perforation in the radiator system  
✅ The radiator is contaminated with dirt  
**Comment**:  An excessively high coolant temperature can have various causes. The radiator may be dirty, the radiator fan may have failed or the  
cooling system may be leaking. In any case, it is advisable to seek professional advice and have the damage repaired.  
  
527. What results in increased fuel consumption of your car?  
✅ A roof rack or ski rack  
❌Excessive tyre pressure  
✅ Transporting unnecessary objects  
**Comment**:  Any additional weight increases fuel consumption. That's why you should only carry what you really need in your car. A roof rack means  
additional mass and increased air resistance, which also increases fuel consumption.  
  
528. Why is an environmentally considerate driving style also beneficial for road safety?  
Because environmentally considerate driving means  
❌that with alternative fuels it is ONLY possible to drive slowly  
✅ avoiding high speeds  
✅ driving in a far-sighted manner  
**Comment**:  Those who drive in an environmentally conscious manner drive with foresight and avoid high speeds. This saves energy and increases road  
safety at the same time. Alternative fuels, on the other hand, have as little to do with possible vehicle speed as they do with road safety.  
  
529. What should you remember when loading luggage into a car luggage compartment?  
I should  
✅ stow the warning triangle in an easily accessible place  
✅ place heavy luggage at the bottom  
✅ secure the luggage against slipping  
**Comment**:  When loading the trunk, don't just remember that the heaviest items belong in the bottom and the luggage must be secured. Breakdowns can   
also occur when traveling: Therefore, stow a warning triangle, safety vest and first aid kit within easy reach.  
  
530. What should you remember when putting winter tyres on your car?  
✅ The tyre inflation pressure should be checked in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines  
✅ You should observe the permissible maximum driving speed for these tyres  
❌The air pressure should be 0.5 bar lower than the manufacturer's guidelines for summer tyres  
**Comment**:  Winter tires (“Alpine” symbol) are only approved for certain maximum speeds, which I must not exceed. In addition, the required tire pressure   
may be different than for summer tires: Follow the manufacturer's instructions.  
  
531. Your car is equipped with winter tyres. What is the meaning of the speed label "max. 190 km/h" on your dashboard?  
The maximum speed of 190 km/h  
❌does not apply to dry road conditions  
✅ may not be exceeded  
❌applies to wintry road conditions only  
**Comment**:  Winter tires (“Alpine” symbol) are only approved for certain maximum speeds, which I am not allowed to exceed. The sticker in my field of vision   
indicates the maximum permitted speed.  
  
532. The rear lighting systems of your car are covered. What has to be done?  
A luminaire rail system with all rear lighting systems  
❌need only be attached for journeys at dusk or during the hours of darkness  
✅ must be attached in any case  
❌need only be attached on journeys longer than 5 km  
**Comment**Lighting devices make a vehicle visible. If they are concealed, e.g. by attachments or load carriers (e.g. for bicycles on cars), important   
lighting devices such as indicators, brake lights, tail lights, reflectors and license plate lights must be mounted on a light carrier so that they   
are visible.  
  
533. To what must you pay particular attention when driving with winter tyres?  
I may  
✅ not exceed the permissible maximum speed for these tyres  
❌only drive as fast as when I am using snow chains  
❌not exceed 80 km/h  
**Comment**:  Winter tires (“Alpine” symbol) are only approved for certain maximum speeds, which I am not allowed to exceed, even if the vehicle's   
performance and road conditions permit it. A sticker in my field of vision indicates the technically permissible maximum speed.  
  
534. You want to transport a person in a vehicle, and that person must remain seated in a wheelchair during the drive. What must you be aware of?  
✅ The person must be secured using a wheelchair-user restraint system  
✅ The wheelchair must be secured using a wheelchair restraint system  
✅ The motor vehicle must be equipped with a wheelchair space  
**Comment**:  If persons are to be transported who must remain seated in a wheelchair during the journey, the transporting vehicle must be equipped with  
an appropriate wheelchair space. Both the wheelchair and the wheelchair user must be secured with appropriate systems.  
  
535.What may be the result of too little coolant in the engine?  
Too little coolant can  
✅ lead to engine damage  
❌lead to an increase of fuel consumption  
✅ lead to overheating of the engine  
**Comment**:  A lack of coolant can cause the engine to overheat, resulting in serious engine damage. For this reason, the engine coolant must be checked   
regularly, preferably weekly if the vehicle is driven a lot.  
  
536. What can negatively affect the functioning of the lane keep assist system?  
✅ The condition of the road markings  
✅ The weather conditions  
✅ Additional road markings within a roadworks site  
**Comment**:  Lane departure warning systems only work reliably if the lane markings are clearly visible. Weather conditions, dirty markings and roadworks   
with additional yellow and white markings can cause problems!  
  
537. How can you check the engine oil level?  
Depending on the motor vehicle, by checking the  
✅ driver information system  
✅ oil dipstick  
❌instant fuel consumption display  
**Comment**:  An engine oil level that is too low is dangerous, which is why I regularly check the level via the driver information system or with the oil   
dipstick. When the indicator light comes on, it is usually already critical.  
  
538. What causes avoidable noise?  
❌By driving with a roof-rack  
✅ By sounding the horn as a greeting  
✅ By firmly slamming doors shut  
**Comment**Noise is a type of environmental pollution that can easily be avoided, e.g. by not honking horns to greet people or slamming doors loudly.  
  
539. What is the function of your vehicle’s emergency brake assist?  
The emergency brake assist  
❌brakes the speed of my vehicle if the event I accidentally overrun the traffic lane boundary  
✅ issues warnings about the immediate risk of a rear-end collision  
✅ can reduce the risk of injury in the event of an unavoidable collision  
**Comment**Many driver assistance systems are designed for road safety, some for comfort. Emergency braking can be vital for survival.   
Emergency Brake Assist therefore increases safety by warning of the immediate danger of a rear-end collision and can reduce the risk   
of injury in the event of unavoidable collisions. This assistant does not react to the accidental crossing of a lane boundary line   
(e.g. the lane departure warning system does this).  
  
540. Your car is equipped with an automatic start-stop system. What is the environmental protection benefit from using this vehicle system?  
The automatic start-stop system reduces  
❌tyre wear  
✅ fuel consumption  
✅ noise pollution  
**Comment**:  The automatic start-stop system is an environmentally friendly feature that helps to reduce fuel consumption and noise pollution   
from my vehicle. However, this has nothing to do with tire wear, which I can influence, for example, through my driving style.  
  
541. What is the maximum permitted length of a car and trailer vehicle combination, without a protruding load?  
Answer: 18m  
  
542. What must you do if the oil pressure warning light fails to switch off after starting the engine?  
✅ I check the engine oil level  
✅ I shut down the engine immediately  
❌I continue driving until the next oil change  
**Comment**:  Indicator lights have different functions. The oil pressure indicator light indicates problems with the engine oil. Stop the engine   
immediately and check the oil level. Without sufficient oil, the engine will be damaged.  
  
543. Your vehicle’s brake light is not working. What is the right course of action?  
❌I arrange for the brake fluid to be changed  
✅ I attempt to determine the cause and repair the fault myself  
✅ I arrange for a garage to repair the vehicle  
**Comment**:  Brake light defective? This is a dangerous defect: if I can't fix it myself, have it repaired immediately by a specialist. Replacing   
the brake fluid has no effect on the brake light and cannot rectify the defect.  
  
544. What is the function of your vehicle’s high-beam assist during hours of darkness?  
The high-beam assist  
✅ activates the high beam when the ambient conditions are suitable  
❌cleans the headlamp for the high beam  
✅ dims the high beam in good time when there is oncoming traffic  
**Comment**:  The high beam assistant automatically adjusts the high beam to the conditions: In suitable conditions, the high beam switches on automatically   
and is dimmed in good time, e.g. in oncoming traffic. The headlights are cleaned by a headlight washer system if necessary, not by the light assistant.  
  
545. In which cases is it imperative to test the brakes?  
✅ When you drive a different vehicle  
✅ If a vehicle has not been used for a longer period  
❌Each time the engine oil is changed  
**Comment**:  Safety depends to a large extent on the proper functioning of the brakes. Test the brakes if the vehicle has been parked for any length of time.   
This is particularly important if you are taking over another vehicle, as you do not know the condition of the brakes.  
  
546. The electronic stability control (ESC) display light has flashed several times. What is the correct course of action in this situation?  
❌I maintain my speed, because the ESC system ensures I can continue driving safely  
✅ I reduce my speed, because it is too high  
❌I go to a garage, because the ESC display is indicating a fault  
**Comment**:  If the display for the driving dynamics control (ESC) lights up, the assistance system has already had to intervene. This is a clear warning   
of a particularly high risk of skidding! I must immediately reduce my speed so that the system no longer has to intervene: Even technical systems have   
physical limits.  
  
547. When operating a vehicle, what must you observe regarding the vehicle height?  
I have to  
✅ ascertain the actual height of the load protruding beyond the external bodywork of the vehicle  
✅ observe the restraints applicable to the actual height  
✅ ascertain the actual height of the vehicle  
**Comment**:  In general, the vehicle and load together must not be higher than 4 m and no wider than 2.55 m. Particularly in the case of overhanging loads,   
I must inform myself about the actual height in order to be able to comply with existing restrictions or prohibitions on the actual height (e.g. in the   
case of bridges or power lines).  
  
548. How can you tell when you need to bring your vehicle in for its next vehicle roadworthiness test?  
✅ By looking at the inspection tag on the rear license plate  
❌By reading the entry in the operating manual for my vehicle  
✅ By reading the entry made in the registration certificate Part I  
**Comment**:  The inspection sticker on the rear license plate shows the month and year of the next main inspection (HU). The month and year of the next main   
inspection are also entered in the registration certificate part I.  
  
549. How can you save fuel if you drive a car with an automatic gearbox?  
✅ Do not press down hard on the accelerator when moving off  
✅ Use the eco mode when driving  
❌Switch off the engine when driving down a gradient  
**Comment**:  If the accelerator pedal is depressed quickly to accelerate in vehicles with an automatic transmission, the transmission shifts down a gear   
and the gear is extended to high engine speeds (“kick down”). This increases fuel consumption enormously. If you want to save fuel, do without the   
“kick down” and select the (eco) eco mode.  
  
550. You are driving an electric vehicle. When can recuperation inhibit the braking action?  
When driving  
❌in eco mode  
✅ with a fully charged battery  
✅ at less than the battery’s operating temperature  
**Comment**:  Recuperation recovers energy by braking when driving an electric car. If the battery is fully charged or has not yet reached its operating   
temperature, the recuperation effect may be limited. Eco mode would increase rather than reduce recuperation.  
  
551. While driving, you use your vehicle’s adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. What must you anticipate in these weather conditions?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_03_119.jpg)  
✅ I have to personally control my speed and distance  
❌The ACC stops the vehicle  
✅ The functionality of the ACC may be negatively affected  
**Comment**:  Certain assistance systems reach their limits in unfavorable weather conditions. Swirling slush, snowfall and rain can have a negative   
impact on the sensors. That's why I shouldn't rely on the system in this weather and am better off regulating my speed and distance myself.  
  
552. With which driving task can the lane keep assist system with steering override help the driver? ----IMP  
❌When overtaking  
✅ When driving in a straight line  
❌When turning  
**Comment**:  Lane Keeping Assist only helps or assists when driving straight ahead. It is not capable of turning or overtaking.  
  
553. What should I ensure when refilling with engine oil?  
❌That I refill the engine oil while the engine is running  
✅ That I do not exceed the maximum fill level  
✅ That I use engine oil that meets the vehicle manufacturer's specifications  
**Comment**:  Engine oils are very different ❌depending on the load. It is therefore important to pay attention to the required specification and   
not to fill up to the maximum level. It goes without saying that the engine must be switched off when topping up.  
  
554. What is the maximum height allowed above the roadway for a red light marking a load extending to the back?  
❌2.00 m  
✅ 1.50 m  
❌2.50 m  
**Comment**:  A light that indicates a load projecting to the rear must not be mounted more than 1.50 m above the road.  
  
555. What should be noted when changing a tyre using a car jack?  
❌The car jack must always be placed at the mid-point of the vehicle's length  
✅ The car jack may only be applied at the positioning points specified by the vehicle manufacturer  
✅ The ground surface must always be stable and skid-resistant  
**Comment**:  The attachment points for jacks vary from vehicle to vehicle and are described in the operating instructions. If the jack is positioned   
at a point not intended for this purpose, damage may occur. When attaching the jack, also ensure that it is on firm ground.  
  
556. Under what conditions will the lane keep assist system with steering override function optimally?  
❌Where there are patches of snow on the road surface  
✅ Where there are clear road markings  
❌Where there are additional roadworks markings  
**Comment**:  Lane Keeping Assist only works reliably if the lane markings are clearly visible. Weather conditions such as markings obscured by snow   
and roadworks with yellow and white markings can cause problems!  
  
557. You want to carry a child in your car. When must you use a child seat for this purpose? ----IMP  
❌If the child is older than 12 years old and is taller than 150 cm  
❌If the child is older than 12 years old and is under 150 cm in height  
✅ If the child is younger than 12 years old and is under 150 cm in height  
**Comment**:  The risk of accidental injury is particularly high for children. Because normal seat belts do not yet “fit”, children under the age of   
12 who are smaller than 150 cm must be secured by special restraint devices. The seat must be suitable for the height, weight and age of the   
child and officially approved. Approval can be recognized by the ECE test mark.  
  
558. What can cause a dangerous situation?  
✅ Cutting corners  
❌Driving too far behind the vehicle in front  
✅ Dipping your headlights too late  
**Comment**:  Anyone who does not behave correctly on the road endangers others. For example, cutting corners takes space away from oncoming traffic,   
which can result in a collision or dangerous evasive maneuvers. If you turn off your headlights too late, you endanger other road users by   
massively obstructing their view.  
  
559. What is the right course of action here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_043_1.jpg)  
✅ The red car may proceed ahead of the motorbike  
✅ I may proceed ahead of the motorbike  
❌I may proceed ahead of the red car  
**Comment**:  Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The vehicle coming from the left and I have to wait until the vehicle on the priority road   
with the right turn has passed. Then I can drive because the rule RIGHT BEFORE LEFT applies to the roads below. The vehicle coming from my left goes last.  
  
560. Who has priority here? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_039.jpg)  
❌The red truck  
✅ The electric scooter  
❌Me  
**Comment**:  Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The oncoming vehicle and I are driving on the priority road with the right of way.   
The oncoming vehicle follows the course of the priority road. As a left-turner leaving the priority road, I must allow the oncoming vehicle to pass.   
The vehicle on the left is coming from the side road and must “give way” to the other vehicle and me.  
  
561. You would like to cross over a priority road. The view to both sides is very restricted due to parked vehicles. What should you do?  
❌I sound my horn to warn crossing traffic  
✅ I carefully ease my way into the junction  
❌I quickly cross over the junction  
**Comment**:  If visibility is restricted, you must “feel your way” carefully into the junction, i.e. drive forward slowly until you can see the   
other road. Only when the traffic situation allows you to do so may you cross the priority road quickly.  
  
562. What is correct in this situation?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_37_012.jpg)  
❌Traffic turning left may proceed  
✅ Traffic turning right may proceed  
❌Traffic continuing ahead may proceed  
**Comment**:  Arrows on the road indicate the direction of travel at the next junction. Together with the red traffic light across the lane,   
this means that drivers going straight ahead and those turning left must wait. The traffic light with the green arrow only applies to   
drivers turning right, who are allowed to drive in this situation.  
  
563. What is the right thing to do? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_038.jpg)  
✅ I have to give way to the blue car  
✅ I have to give way to the motorcycle  
❌I may drive out before the blue car  
**Comment**:  Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The motorcycle is riding on the priority road and therefore first. The vehicle coming   
from the right and I are driving on roads that require waiting. The following applies to me: Whoever is coming from the right has right of way.   
I must let traffic coming from the right go first.  
  
564. What is the right course of action here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_047_1.jpg)  
I have to  
✅ allow the green bus to pass through  
✅ stop on the stop line  
❌allow the motorbike to pass through  
**Comment**:   The STOP sign is clear: I have to stop at the stop line and give way to the traffic on the priority road. The road from the left is   
not part of this. The rule “right before left” applies to traffic coming from the left ❌and I am coming from the right. So I may drive after   
the vehicle on the priority road, but in front of the vehicle coming from the left.  
  
565. When driving on main roads, which vehicles must use the hard shoulders where possible?  
✅ Mopeds  
❌Small-engine motorcycles  
✅ Slow-moving agricultural tractors and machinery  
**Comment**:  If there is sufficient road space to the right of the lane boundary (continuous line) on rural roads, this is referred to as a hard   
shoulder. Agricultural tractors or work machines, carts, mopeds and similar slow vehicles must use this hard shoulder.  
  
566. What is the recommended speed that applies to cars and motorcycles on autobahns?  
Answer: 130 km/h  
  
567. You are driving in the left of two lanes and approaching a vehicle that has just started to overtake. What do you do?  
✅ Keep an adequate distance behind the vehicle in front  
✅ Allow the vehicle in front to overtake  
❌Close up to the vehicle in front, sound your horn and flash your lights  
**Comment**:  Allow the vehicle to pull out and do not tailgate it. Keep a sufficient distance. Allow the vehicle in front to complete its overtaking  
maneuver in peace, even if you have to wait a little longer.  
  
568. What must you reckon with here? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_08_005.jpg)  
✅ The vehicle in front changing lanes  
✅ Denser traffic beyond the underpass  
❌The right-hand lane coming to an end  
**Comment**:  The left lane will soon end. You should therefore expect the vehicle in front to move into your lane. Because you cannot see the   
further course of the road, you should also expect traffic to become more congested after the bend.  
  
569. You want to leave the motorway. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_08_030_1.jpg)  
✅ I use the speedometer to check my speed at short intervals  
❌I reduce my speed only once I am at the turn  
✅ I reduce my speed now  
**Comment**:  Freeway exits often have tight bends. Therefore, reduce your speed on the deceleration lane right from the start. As you often   
underestimate your own speed after driving fast, look at the speedometer and slow down again if necessary. Then the bend is no danger.  
  
570. What is the minimum safety distance you should maintain from the vehicle ahead when driving at a speed of 100 km/h?  
Answer: 50m  
**Comment**:  There is a rule of thumb for the safety distance when driving outside built-up areas: “Half the speedometer value in meters”,   
which results in a distance of at least 35 m at a speed of 70 km/h and approx. 50 m at a speed of 100 km/h.  
  
571. Why should you avoid overtaking alongside the roadworks site?  
✅ The risk of an accident increases significantly  
✅ Vehicles in the right-hand lane may cross over the yellow road markings  
✅ The time saved is frequently insignificant  
**Comment**:  Things can get tight around highway construction sites. There are often many large heavy goods vehicles on the road. I should   
refrain from overtaking here because large vehicles occasionally overtake the yellow markings, which significantly increases the risk of   
accidents. In addition, there are usually speed limits and time savings are usually minimal due to the limited stretches of road.  
  
572.What applies on clearways for motor vehicles only?  
✅ No U-turns  
✅ Join the clearway only at crossroads and junctions  
❌In darkness, you may drive faster than the range of visibility allowed by dipped headlights  
**Comment**:  Motorways are intended for rapid progress. For this reason, turning and reversing is prohibited. If you have missed your turn-off,   
you must continue to the next junction or intersection. You may only enter a motorway at junctions and crossroads. You can also make a U-turn   
there, observing the traffic signs.  
  
573. A lane terminates on a road with several lanes heading in the same direction. What should you do when driving on the through-lane?  
I have to  
❌make eye-contact and then decide according to the situation  
❌drive past the vehicles on the terminating lane  
✅ allow traffic on the terminating lane to merge in accordance with the alternate merging procedure  
**Comment**:  If a lane ends or is closed (e.g. due to roadworks or an obstacle), the “merge and let merge” method is used. This means that each  
driver in the free lane allows the next vehicle that is prevented from continuing to move over.  
  
574. What is the right course of action now?  
❌I stay in the centre lane  
❌I move into the left-hand lane  
✅ I move into the right-hand lane  
**Comment**:   If, at a speed of 120 km/h, the right-hand lane is clear and visible from a distance, I must move over to the right-hand lane   
(right-hand driving rule). I may only stay in the middle to overtake or if I am not obstructing anyone and the next slower vehicle is at   
least within sight. TIP: Watch the movie questions several times, those behind me are slower than me, everything is free in front of me   
❌including the right-hand lane.  
  
575. Your vehicle has broken down on the autobahn. What must you remember when having it towed away?  
✅ During towing, both vehicles must have their hazard warning lights switched on  
✅ You must leave the autobahn at the next exit  
❌You may continue along the autobahn to the exit nearest a suitable garage  
**Comment**:  If a vehicle is being towed away, the hazard warning lights on both vehicles must be switched on. The two vehicles form a long   
and slow obstacle. This is particularly dangerous on highways because traffic moves very quickly there. For this reason, the tow truck   
must leave the highway at the next exit.  
  
576. What is the right course of action now? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_1_07_026_1_ende.jpg)  
❌I move into the left-hand lane  
✅ I allow the tractor to pull into the lane  
✅ I reduce my speed further  
**Comment**:  The slow tractor drives exemplarily on the hard shoulder to let the faster ones pass. The hard shoulder apparently ends just   
before it, because it turns left. Houses also indicate a village. The left-hand lane is for oncoming traffic and not suitable for swerving,   
especially as the red and white traffic sign in front of the tractor marks a bend that I can't see. Now I have to slow down and allow the   
tractor to merge. TIP: Watch the movie again and literally “look ahead”!  
  
577.What must you anticipate on the other side of this crest in the road? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_07_103.jpg)  
✅ There may be a slow moving vehicle on my side of the road  
✅ A vehicle may be stationary there  
✅ There may be an oncoming vehicle on my side of the road  
**Comment**:  Caution! A vehicle may have broken down or be driving slowly behind this crest. As the road is not very wide, oncoming traffic  
may be sharing your lane.  
  
578. What do you have to observe in a traffic situation like this one?  
I may  
✅ cross the centre line in order to overtake  
✅ not cross the centre line if this would endanger other traffic  
✅ cross the centre line in order to pass by the obstruction  
**Comment**:  Guidelines are interrupted lines. They may be crossed, e.g. to overtake or to pass an obstacle, if this does not endanger other   
traffic (including the person being overtaken).  
  
579. You are on a roundabout. What should you remember?  
✅ You can only drive over a central island if this is unavoidable because of your vehicle's size  
✅ You are not allowed to stop on the roadway in a roundabout  
✅ You must indicate to leave the roundabout  
  
580. Why do you have to wait before the left turn?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_2_09_002_1_ende.jpg)
Because of the  
❌ bicycle  
✅ motorbike  
❌ car  
**Comment**:  When turning left, I not only have to watch out for oncoming traffic, but also for vehicles behind the oncoming traffic: What does the oncoming vehicle intend to do, e.g. turn (indicators)? Wasn't there a 
motorcycle or another vehicle in the shadow of the oncoming vehicle? It may be driving straight ahead. I prefer to avoid dangerous encounters when turning. TIP: Watch the movie again and watch out for movement or 
indicators in oncoming traffic! 
  
581. What is true in this situation? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_4_41_020_1.jpg)  
I may  
✅ not drive on the restricted zone  
❌use the restricted zone to make a turn  
❌use the restricted zone if there is a traffic jam  
**Comment**:  A restricted area carries the meaning in its name: The marked area is closed. Usually for safety reasons. I am not allowed   
to drive on it. Not even for turning or as an alternative area in the event of a traffic jam.  
  
582. Which motor vehicles may freely choose their lane inside built-up areas?right  
Answer: All motor vehicles with a permissible total mass of up to   
___3.5t___  
**Comment**:  Within built-up areas, motor vehicles with a maximum permissible mass of up to 3.5 tons may freely choose their lane on roads   
with several marked lanes for one direction ❌except on freeways.  
  
583. On what roads does the recommended speed of 130 km/h apply? ----IMP  
✅ Motorways  
✅ On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with at least two marked lanes for each direction  
✅ On vehicle roadways not inside a built-up area, with separate carriageways for each direction  
**Comment**:  The speed limit of 130 km/h applies not only on freeways, but also outside built-up areas on motorways with physically separated   
lanes or with at least two marked lanes for each direction.  
  
584. What is the right course of action now? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_1_07_025_ende.jpg)  
✅ I brake sharply  
✅ I yield my right of way  
❌I continue driving as before  
**Comment**:  Not really dangerous. I'm on the priority road. But the guy on the left doesn't brake at all. He must have overlooked me:   
That's why I prefer to brake hard and give up my right of way. Under no circumstances do I drive on unchanged, as that would only   
put me in unnecessary danger. TIP: Watch the movie again and watch out for the person approaching from the left!  
  
585. You are driving on the autobahn in light traffic. How long are you allowed to stay in the left-hand lane?   ----IMP  
❌All the time, provided no other vehicle wants to overtake you  
✅ As long as you are driving behind a vehicle which is overtaking in the left-hand lane  
✅ As long as is necessary to overtake other vehicles  
**Comment**:  The right-hand driving rule also applies on highways. The left-hand lane may only be used for overtaking. Only stay there as   
long as you are overtaking other vehicles or if you are driving behind a vehicle that is overtaking. When you have completed your   
overtaking maneuver, move back into the right-hand lane.  
  
586. What should you do here?  
I should  
❌drive to the left past the damaged road surface  
✅ continue driving in my lane  
✅ greatly reduce my speed  
  
587. You are approaching a level crossing with barriers. Where must you wait if you would have to stop on the rails  
in case of traffic congestion?  
❌ Level with the barrier  
✅ In front of the St. Andrew's Cross  
❌ Just before the rails  
**Comment**:  Approach level crossings at moderate speed only. Watch what is happening carefully. Wait in front of the 
St. Andrew's cross if you have to stop at the level crossing due to a traffic jam or slow-moving traffic. Cross the level 
crossing quickly.  
  
588. You are driving on this motorway. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_4_41_004_1.jpg)  
❌ I remain in my current lane  
✅ I move into the right-hand lane  
❌ I only use the left-hand lane if there is a breakdown  
**Comment**:  On roads outside built-up areas, on highways and in roadworks on highways, the right-hand driving rule applies.  
If possible, I use the right-hand lane. The left lane is only to be used for overtaking or in heavy traffic.  
  
589. What must you be aware of when driving along narrow avenues?  
On narrow avenues  
✅ it is frequently difficult for me to see into the road bends  
❌ I am protected against black ice  
✅ I have to drive particularly defensively  
**Comment**:  Narrow avenues require a high level of concentration - and defensive driving: Bends are difficult to see and sun,  
rain and icy conditions can be particularly dangerous here. Avenues cannot protect against this.  
  
590. What is prohibited when using motorways?  
✅ Performing U-turns  
✅ Stopping on the hard shoulder  
✅ Reversing  
**Comment**:  The purpose of highways is to make rapid progress. Turning and reversing is therefore prohibited here. Stopping  
on the hard shoulder (without necessity) is also not permitted. The hard shoulder is reserved for emergency vehicles. I may  
only stop on the hard shoulder in emergencies (e.g. flat tire), but must then secure the danger zone in accordance with regulations.  
  
591. What must you anticipate in this parking area?  
✅ Trucks that are incorrectly parked  
✅ Vehicles emerging from parking spaces  
✅ People on the roadway  
**Comment**:  Special care must be taken in parking lots. Always expect people to enter the carriageway, for example when they 
leave their vehicle. Vehicles parked incorrectly or pulling out can also be dangerous here.  
  
592. What should you anticipate when driving out the exit slip road?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_08_033_1.jpg)  
✅ A fallen load  
✅ People on the carriageway  
✅ A broken-down vehicle  
**Comment**:  The warning triangle on the side of the road draws attention to a breakdown situation - presumably directly on 
the exit bend. I cannot see the exit. I must therefore expect that there may be a broken-down vehicle, a dropped load or people 
on the road (e.g. in the course of repairing a breakdown). Caution!  
  
593. You hold a Class B driving licence. What trailer are you allowed to tow?  
A trailer with a maximum authorised mass  
✅ over 750 kg, if the maximum authorised mass of the vehicle combination does not exceed 3,500 kg  
❌ of 3,500 kg  
✅ up to 750 kg  
**Comment**:  With a category B driving license, I am allowed to drive motor vehicles up to 3500 kg gross vehicle weight (GVW).  
The following combinations with trailers are permitted: - trailers up to 750 kg GVW, - trailers with more than 750 kg, provided  
the GVW of the combination (car and trailer) does not exceed 3500 kg. A trailer with 3500 kg  
GVW does not leave a single gram for the vehicle. I need a driving license category other than B for this.  
  
594. Your vehicle is snowed under. What do you have to do before you drive off?  
I have to  
✅ remove ice and snow from the windows and mirrors  
❌allow the engine to warm up  
✅ remove ice and snow from the lighting systems including during daytime  
**Comment**:  Good all-round visibility is an important prerequisite for safe driving. If windows and mirrors are iced up, 
I have to remove the ice not only from the windows for my own visibility, but also from the lighting equipment: - So that 
I can see and be seen better.  
  
595. What must you remember when loading a trailer?  
The load  
✅ must not project more than 1 m beyond the rear reflectors, unless specially marked  
✅ must be securely packed  
❌ must not project more than 1 m beyond the front of the towing vehicle  
**Comment**:  The load must not endanger anyone and must therefore be stowed securely on the loading area. Without 
additional marking, the load must not protrude more than 1 m beyond the rear reflectors.  
  
596. What are the advantages of an automatic anti-locking device (ABS)?  
❌ On setting off, wheelspin is prevented  
❌ The danger of tipping over is reduced when braking on bends  
✅ It is possible to brake heavily and avoid an obstacle at the same time  
**Comment**:  The anti-lock braking system ensures that the wheels do not lock when braking. As soon as a wheel tends to lock,  
the brake pressure is electronically lowered, increased or maintained at lightning speed. As a result, the vehicle remains  
steerable even when braking hard. Simultaneous braking and swerving is possible.  
  
597. Your vehicle is snowed under. What do you have to do before you drive off?  
I have to  
✅ remove ice and snow from the mirrors  
✅ remove ice and snow from the roof of the vehicle  
✅ remove ice and snow from the windows  
**Comment**:  Good all-round visibility is an important prerequisite for safe driving. If windows and mirrors are iced up, I not  
only have to remove the ice from the windows for my own visibility - but also from the roof if necessary! So that it doesn't slide  
onto my windshield when I brake or endanger others behind me while I'm driving.  
  
598. You are in your car towing a trailer which has no brakes and you approach a long steep downhill slope. What is correct?  
✅ Make allowance for the pushing effect of the trailer  
✅ Reduce speed, if necessary, engage low gear in time, be ready to brake  
❌ Relieve the car brakes by disengaging the clutch at frequent intervals  
**Comment**:  On steep downhill gradients, the vehicle always accelerates, especially when an unbraked trailer is pushing. You should therefore reduce speed early on   
and use the engine brake by shifting into a lower gear in good time. Be ready to brake at all times.  
  
599. What does a rear-wheel drive car tend to do if you accelerate too much on a bend?  
❌ The front end tends to turn out to the side  
❌ The car tends to understeer  
✅ The rear end tends to turn out to the side  
**Comment**:  If you accelerate too much in a bend, a rear-wheel drive car tends to swerve out of the back.  
  
600. You are driving within a built-up area during darkness. Oncoming drivers are flashing their headlights as a warning to you. What might this mean in this situation?  
❌I should turn on my main beam lights  
✅ My vehicle is dazzling oncoming vehicles  
✅ I have forgotten to switch on my dipped headlights  
**Comment**:  If oncoming drivers signal with their headlights flashing, this could mean that they are being dazzled by my  
vehicle lights: I should possibly check the headlight range setting or switch off the high beam. Or have I forgotten to switch  
on my low beam? If I switch on the high beam now, I will only dazzle oncoming traffic even more: not a good idea.  
  
601. What are the advantages of an automatic anti-locking device (ABS)?  
✅ Steering control is retained even when braking heavily  
Bends can be taken considerably faster  
✅ The wheels do not lock when braking  
  
602. A single-axle trailer has an actual gross weight of 600 kg. What is the minimum possible vertical load?  
✅ 24 kg (= 4%)  
❌ 90 kg (= 15%)  
❌ 60 kg (= 10%)  
**Comment**: When loading a single-axle trailer, you must always ensure sufficient drawbar load, otherwise there is a  
risk of skidding. The towing vehicle (see operating instructions for permissible drawbar load) must support at least 4%  
of the actual mass as drawbar load. If the trailer weighs 600 kg with load, for example, the drawbar load must be at least  
4% of this, i.e. (600 : 100 x 4) 24 kg.   
  
603. How can you achieve sufficient visibility through the windscreen?  
✅ Switch on the windscreen wipers from time to time when it is foggy  
❌ When the windscreen is steamed up, switch the ventilator off and keep the windows closed  
✅ When there is slush, switch on the windscreen wipers already before slush is thrown onto your windscreen by other vehicles  
**Comment**: Water settles on the windshield in fog. Therefore, switch on the windshield wiper from time to time. In slushy  
conditions, slush thrown up can make visibility difficult. Therefore, switch on the windshield wipers in good time. Make sure  
there is sufficient antifreeze in the windshield washer system.  
  
604. You want to park your single-axle trailer (overrun brakes, 1000 kg permissible total mass) on a slope. What must you do?  
❌ Engage the reverse lock  
✅ Pull the parking brake  
✅ Place wheel chocks under the wheels  
**Comment**: To prevent a parked trailer from rolling away on a slope, it must always be secured before uncoupling. To do  
this, apply the parking brake and place wheel chocks in front of the wheels.  
  
605. You want to couple a trailer to your car. Where will you find details about the maximum permissible vertical loading of your car?  
In the  
✅ operating manual  
❌ registration certificate Part II  
✅ registration certificate Part I  
**Comment**:  The permissible drawbar load for trailer operation is specified by the manufacturer of the towing vehicle and 
can be found in the operating instructions and in the registration certificate, Part I.  
  
606. You suddenly have to brake when cornering on a wet carriageway. What special aspects exist with a vehicle equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS)?  
❌ The vehicle will always remain stable  
✅ The steering capability is retained for longer  
❌ It is not possible for the vehicle to skid out of the bend  
**Comment**:  Emergency braking is a tricky business with and without ABS. If I suddenly have to brake hard on a bend in wet  
conditions, the steering ability is retained for longer with the anti-lock braking system (ABS). Nevertheless, it is important  
to reduce speed before cornering, especially in unfavorable weather conditions.  
  
607. What cars that are driven within designated environmental zones must display a particulate matter sticker?  
Cars with  
✅ electric motors  
✅ petrol engines  
✅ diesel engines  
**Comment**:  Low emission zones are intended to help reduce harmful air pollution. Only low-emission vehicles are allowed 
to drive in these zones. To make it easier to recognize authorized vehicles, entry is only permitted with a valid sticker. 
The sticker is mandatory for ALL cars - regardless of the respective motorization.  
  
608. What are the advantages of an anti-slip device (ASR)?  
❌No locking of the wheels when braking  
✅ Reduced danger of sliding sideways when setting off on a slippery roadway  
✅ No wheelspin when setting off  
**Comment**:  A traction control system prevents the wheels from spinning when moving off and slipping sideways on slippery roads.  
  
609. What motor vehicles are permitted to enter an environment zone without a fine-particle badge?  
✅ All agricultural and forestry tractors  
✅ All two and three-wheeled motor vehicles  
❌ All motor vehicles with a catalytic converter  
**Comment**:  The “low emission zone” traffic ban does not apply to vehicles with special rights (e.g. police, fire department,  
armed forces), ambulances, work machines and agricultural and forestry tractors as well as light motor vehicles and two - and  
three-wheeled vehicles (e.g. motorcycles, trikes).  
  
610. You want to couple up a trailer with ball coupling. What is correct?  
✅ The electrics must be connected  
❌ The jack wheel must be set so that it can also run when driving  
✅ The claw of the coupling must fit securely around the ball. The locking device must engage  
**Comment**:  If you are attaching a trailer with a ball coupling, the coupling claw must securely enclose the ball head. The safety catch must be engaged. Ensure that the electrical connection between the towing vehicle 
and trailer is established so that the trailer's lighting equipment, among other things, functions properly.  
  
611. You are driving in the wet in a car with trailer on a narrow rural road and are approaching a clearly visible but   
tight left-hand bend.
What should you do?  
✅ I remain in the centre of the lane and only accelerate again once I am back on the straight  
✅ I reduce my speed before the bend  
❌ I only brake once I have reached the apex of the bend  
**Comment**:  Reduce speed before tight bends, otherwise the trailer could skid, especially on wet roads. Accelerate again at the earliest at the apex of the bend, at the transition to the straight. The trailer makes a 
tighter turn: Stay in the middle of the lane so that you do not cut the bend (oncoming traffic!).  
  
612. You want to tow a brake-equipped trailer. Where can you find details or guidelines on the permissible towable mass of your car?  
✅ In the registration certificate Part I of my car  
❌ In the insurance certificate  
❌ In the registration certificate Part I of my trailer  
**Comment**:  The permissible trailer loads (unbraked/braked) for a passenger car can be found in the registration certificate Part I and in the operating instructions for the vehicle. The trailer documents only contain 
information on the trailer.  
  
613. Where do you have to place the emissions sticker for identifying lowemission vehicles?  
✅ Clearly visible on the inside of the windscreen  
❌ Clearly visible on the inside of the rear window  
❌ Clearly visible on the outside of the windscreen  
**Comment**: The stickers authorizing entry into an environmental zone must be easy to recognize and difficult to remove. They must be clearly visible on the inside of the windshield (labeled with the license plate 
number). 
  
614. You want to tow a singe-axle caravan trailer behind your car. What must you check?  
✅ If additional rear-view mirrors must be mounted because of the width of the trailer  
✅ If the permissible trailer load or the permissible coupling of the car are exceeded  
❌ If the trailer is licensed to transport passengers  
**Comment**: If you have a trailer attached, you must check whether road safety is guaranteed. This includes ensuring that the permissible drawbar load of the car is not exceeded and that visibility via the rear-view 
mirrors is not impaired. If visibility is not sufficient due to the width of a caravan, additional rear-view mirrors must be fitted.  
  
615. What is the correct response if, when reversing a combination vehicle the view to the rear is impeded?  
❌ A person directing is only required when driving into a priority road  
✅ If the line-of-sight is broken to the person directing, the vehicle must be stopped  
❌ A person directing is not needed when on a factory premises  
**Comment**:  Do not endanger anyone when reversing. Therefore, when reversing, watch the traffic around you - especially to the rear. If the view to the rear  is obstructed, you need a “guide”: If the line of sight 
between you and the guide is broken, you must always stop!  
  
616. You are driving a car with a fully loaded trailer equipped with overrun braking. What special aspect should be noted here?  
✅ The trailer’s parking brake must be activated before separating the vehicle combination  
✅ Longer downhill drives can cause the trailer brakes to overheat  
✅ The overrun brake system is ineffective on a vehicle combination in an uphill stationary position  
**Comment**:  When towing a fully loaded trailer with an overrun brake, I must bear in mind that the trailer brake can overheat due to the heavy load when driving downhill for long periods. I must also bear in mind that 
the overrun brake cannot work in an uphill vehicle combination. Apart from that, I ALWAYS have to pull the parking brake on the trailer before uncoupling it.  
  
617. What should you note when driving a car after coupling a trailer caravan to it?  
The trailer caravan means that  
✅ the acceleration capacity decreases  
❌ when taking a left or right turn, the necessary cornering radius is reduced  
✅ the overtaking distance is extended  
**Comment**: Compared to a solo vehicle, the distance I need to overtake a car with a caravan is longer due to the greater mass and length of the combination. The acceleration capacity deteriorates accordingly. However, 
the turning radius, e.g. when turning, does not become smaller, but rather larger.  
  
618. What should be observed when positioning the head rests in your car?  
✅ The top of the head should be level with the upper edge of the head rest  
❌ The upper edge of the head rest should conjoin with the upper neck vertebra  
✅ The spacing between the rear of the head and the head rests should be as small as possible  
**Comment**:  Head restraints prevent serious injuries to the cervical spine (e.g. “whiplash”) in the event of an accident. If there are no head restraints on the rear seats, this increases the risk of injury for 
passengers. Adjust the head restraint so that the top edge is level with the height of the head at a small distance.  
  
619. You want to set off in an automatic car (hydraulic converter). What must you know?  
❌ The selector lever must only be moved when the engine has stopped  
❌ The engine revolutions must be raised considerably so that the engine does not stall  
✅ When selecting a gear, the car must, as a rule, be held by the service brakes  
**Comment**: If you are driving an automatic car, use the selector lever to select the desired gear. When starting off, you usually have to step on the brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling unintentionally.  
  
620. What must you bear in mind when loading a single-axle trailer?  
The permissible  
✅ axle load  
✅ total mass  
✅ load on the coupling  
**Comment**: When loading a trailer, you must not exceed the permissible drawbar load, axle load and total mass. Otherwise there is a risk of damage to the vehicle and unfavorable handling of the trailer.  
  
621. What is the effect of an automatic anti-locking device (ABS)?  
✅ The vehicle is braked in the best possible way also on wet roadways  
❌ Aquaplaning is prevented  
✅ Steering control is largely retained when braking  
**Comment**: The anti-lock braking system ensures that the wheels do not lock when braking. As soon as a wheel tends to lock, the brake pressure is electronically lowered, increased or maintained at lightning speed. This 
ensures that the vehicle is braked as effectively as possible even on slippery roads and remains largely steerable.  
  
622. You are in your car towing a fully loaded trailer which has no brakes. What is correct?  
✅ Braking distance increases  
❌ Stopping distance reduces  
❌ Reaction distance increases  
**Comment**: Expect a longer braking distance if you are driving with a fully loaded trailer without its own brakes. The trailer will drag. Therefore, brake earlier than usual.  
  
623. Which dangerous defects can have occurred on a trailer with overrun brakes which has been parked for some time?  
✅ The brakes may not work because of rust  
✅ Cable connections can be defective  
❌ Tyre pressure may have increased greatly due to exposure to the sun  
**Comment**: If a trailer with overrun brakes has been standing for a long time, the brake may be rusted and ineffective. The brake may also be ineffective because the cable connections are damaged. It is therefore 
essential to test the brakes before driving off.  
  
624. You want to pull a trailer. When do additional rear-view mirrors have be to attached to your motor vehicle?  
❌ If you are pulling a caravan or a trailer used in agriculture and forestry  
✅ If it is not possible to observe all relevant road traffic situations without additional rear-view mirrors  
❌ If the load platform of the trailer exceeds a width of 1.5 m and a height of 1 m  
**Comment**: Anticipatory driving involves constantly observing the traffic behind you. Therefore, sufficient visibility to the rear must be ensured by the mirrors. Trailers or loads must not obstruct visibility to an
unacceptable extent. If the normal rear-view mirrors are not sufficient, additional rear-view mirrors must be fitted.  
  
625. You are driving a motor vehicle fitted with anti-lock braking system (ABS). How do you achieve the shortest possible   
braking distance?
I apply the brakes  
❌ multiple times at quick intervals and with maximum force  
✅ suddenly and with maximum force  
❌ carefully and then increasingly harder  
**Comment**: To avoid wasting any braking distance in emergency situations, I step on the brake pedal abruptly and with maximum force. In this way, I always achieve the shortest possible braking distance. ABS (ABV) 
prevents the wheels from locking.  
  
626. You want to hitch a trailer with a maximum authorised mass over 750 kg to your car. What must you ensure in this situation?  
✅ The breakaway cable is properly fitted  
✅ That the handle of the ball coupling must be visually and mechanically checked  
✅ Following coupling, that the proper functioning of the trailer’s lighting system is checked  
**Comment**:  If I want to tow a trailer with my car, I must ALWAYS make sure that   
(1.) the handle of the tow ball coupling is correctly closed (check),   
(2.) the breakaway cable is properly attached and   
(3.) the lighting equipment is working (check after coupling).   
This applies to all trailers, including trailers with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 750 kg.  
  
627. When does the braking action of a trailer with overrun brakes start?  
❌ When the brake pedal in the truck is activated  
❌ Before the braking action of the truck starts, so that the truck and trailer remain extended  
✅ When the trailer runs up to the truck  
**Comment**:  If a towing vehicle brakes with an overrun-braked trailer, the trailer is not initially braked and runs onto the towing vehicle. This sets a mechanism in motion that brakes the trailer.  
  
628. You are in your car towing a trailer on a road with oncoming traffic and want to turn left. What must you particularly
remember when you set off again?  
❌ Warn oncoming traffic by flashing your lights  
✅ Consider the reduced acceleration capacity  
✅ Think about the length of your car and trailer combination  
**Comment**:  If you are carrying a trailer, you have a lower acceleration capacity due to the higher mass. Take the length of the train into account when turning left: oncoming traffic could be there before you have 
completed your turn.  
  
629. You are driving with a trailer on a road with potholes. Your combination vehicle begins to swing up. What must you do now?  
I have to  
❌ accelerate to keep the combination vehicle in a straight line  
❌ counter-steer quickly to prevent skidding  
✅ reduce my speed to avoid skidding  
**Comment**: On a road with potholes, a trailer can easily “rock”, i.e. bounce or lurch. The traction between the trailer tires and the road is lost and there is a risk of skidding. The only way to prevent this is to 
reduce speed. Accelerating or hasty steering movements actually increase the danger.  
  
630. How do you drive down a descending gradient safely?  
I take my foot off the accelerator completely and  
❌ drive in neutral  
✅ select a gear in which I am not required to brake a great deal  
❌ switch the ignition off  
**Comment**: To prevent the brakes from overheating, I let the engine brake and shift to a lower gear before the downhill section. In automatic mode, I engage a lower gear.  
  
631. What changes when a caravan trailer is towed?  
✅ The distance for overtaking increases considerably  
❌ The braking distance is reduced considerably  
✅ Hasty movements of the steering wheel increase the danger of skidding  
**Comment**: When driving with a caravan, the acceleration capacity of your vehicle is reduced by the additional mass. Expect considerably longer overtaking distances and take the length of your vehicle combination into 
account when rejoining. Avoid hasty steering movements - they increase the risk of skidding.  
  
632. What number of trailers may be towed behind a car?  
Answer:  
1 trailer(s)  
**Comment**: Only one trailer may ever be carried behind a car; this applies to category B (also with key number B196) and BE. The different driving licenses only allow different maximum permissible masses of the 
combination.  
  
633. What motor vehicles engaged in the commercial or paid transport of goods, are prohibited from driving on Sundays and public holidays?  
✅ Trucks towing a trailer  
✅ Trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 7.5 t  
❌ Cars towing a trailer  
**Comment**:  On Sundays and public holidays, a driving ban applies from midnight to 10 p.m. for trucks over 7.5 t gross vehicle weight and trucks with trailers transporting goods for commercial or paid purposes. 
Exceptions (e.g. for combined goods transport) are regulated by Section 30 of the Road Traffic Regulations (StVO). The ban does not apply to cars, not even with trailers. 
  
634. What is the effect of the cornering characteristics of a combination vehicle (car towing a caravan) when taking a turn?  
The caravan  
✅ can jut out  
❌ generally follows the track of the car  
✅ can cut the corner  
**Comment**:  When I am on the road with a vehicle combination, I must pay particular attention to the behavior of the trailer on bends: It can swing out to the right over the edge of the road or cut the bend (left-hand 
bend) or swing out over the middle of the road (right-hand bend).  
  
635. What must you do when you see this traffic sign? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_40_003.jpg)  
✅ Reduce speed before the bend  
✅ Drive as far as possible over on the right-hand side  
**Comment**: There is a sharp left-hand bend. Centrifugal force is at work when cornering. It tries to pull the vehicle to the outside of the bend, i.e. to the outside right in a left-hand bend. The faster you drive, the 
greater the centrifugal force. You must therefore reduce speed before the bend. Also, drive as far to the right as possible: this allows you to make the best use of the curve radius and not get too close to oncoming 
traffic.  
  
636. Why should you not apply the clutch when driving on a long, steep downhill slope?  
✅ Because this causes unnecessary wear of the brakes  
❌ Because in this case the brake servo unit will no longer function  
✅ Because the braking action of the engine will have no effect  
**Comment**: If you roll down a slope with the clutch depressed, the power flow is interrupted and the engine braking effect cannot take effect. The vehicle would roll downhill faster and faster and you would have to 
constantly step on the brakes. This is dangerous: the brakes become hot, their effectiveness decreases and wear increases. Let the engine help you brake by shifting to a lower gear before the downhill section.  
  
637. How can you achieve sufficient visibility through the windscreen?  
✅ Switch on the windscreen wipers from time to time when it is foggy  
✅ When there is slush, switch on the windscreen wipers already before slush is thrown onto your windscreen by other vehicles  
❌ When the windscreen is steamed up, switch the ventilator off and keep the windows closed  
**Comment**: Water settles on the windshield in fog. Therefore, switch on the windshield wiper from time to time. In slushy conditions, slush thrown up can make visibility difficult. Therefore, switch on the windshield 
wipers in good time. Make sure there is sufficient antifreeze in the windshield washer system.  
  
638. What can result if you accelerate too hard when driving a front-wheel drive car through a road bend?  
✅ The front of the car can swerve  
❌ The rear of the car can swerve  
✅ Steerability can be reduced  
**Comment**: If you drive too fast, you lose control of your vehicle. If I accelerate too much in a bend, a front-wheel drive car tends to break out at the front. This also restricts steering. A rear-wheel drive vehicle is 
more likely to skid over the rear axle. 
  
639. What must you do after coupling up a single-axle trailer with overrun brakes?  
✅ Raise the jack wheel, if fitted, to the highest setting  
✅ Attach the brakeaway cable to the coupling of the motor vehicle  
✅ Check that the brakes are working  
**Comment**: After coupling a trailer with an overrun brake, it is essential to check the function of the brake. In addition, an existing jockey wheel must be moved to the top position and the breakaway cable attached to 
the trailer coupling of the motor vehicle.  
  
640. Where are you particularly at risk during an overtaking manoeuvre here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_03_038.jpg)  
✅ When driving out of the truck’s wind-sheltered area  
❌ When changing lane after overtaking  
✅ When driving into the truck’s wind-sheltered area  
**Comment**:  A strong crosswind (indicated here by the red and white tornado) causes several hazards when overtaking a truck:  
  **1**. when entering the slipstream, it suddenly disappears and my vehicle pulls to the right.  
  **2**. when pulling out, the wind pushes my vehicle significantly to the left again and I have to counter-steer.  
  When changing lanes after overtaking, however, the crosswind is constant and not a particular hazard.  
  
641. You want to turn left. What driving line should you maintain?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_09_019.jpg)  
❌ The left driving line  
❌ Both driving lines are possible  
✅ The right driving line  
**Comment**:  This is a “normal” road without one-way traffic, i.e. traffic is permitted in both directions. I must keep to the right-hand lane so as not to endanger oncoming traffic: I keep to the right-hand lane here!  
  
642. You are driving on a road that has several marked lanes going in one direction. When should the alternate merging procedure be employed?  
❌ When a merging lane ends on the motorway  
✅ When a lane comes to an end  
✅ If one lane is not continuously free to traffic due to an obstacle  
**Comment**: If a lane ends or is closed (e.g. due to roadworks or an obstacle), the “merge and let merge” method is used.  The zipper procedure begins as close as possible to the bottleneck. 
  
643. What must you anticipate with inclines on motorways?  
✅ Sudden overtaking manoeuvres by other road users  
✅ Slow-moving trucks on the right-hand lane  
✅ Large differences in speed between vehicles  
**Comment**: To increase performance, drivers of heavy trucks and road trains have to downshift before an incline. On freeways, this can lead to large speed differences to the slow-moving trucks in the right-hand lane - 
and to sudden overtaking maneuvers.

645. What is the right course of action? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_017.jpg)  
✅ I have to allow the motorcycle to pass through  
❌ I have to allow the bus to pass through  
✅ I take priority before the bus   
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. Oncoming traffic and I have “right of way” at this junction, cross traffic from the right and left must wait. As a left-turner, however, I must first allow the 
oncoming vehicle to pass before I turn.  
  
646. What is the right course of action? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_117_1.jpg)  
I have to  
✅ stop on the stop line  
✅ give way to the bus  
✅ give way to the green car  
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. My oncoming traffic and I must observe the “Stop. Give way” sign, stop at the stop line and allow oncoming traffic to pass. As a left-turner, I must then allow 
oncoming traffic to pass first. I drive last.  
  
647. You want to turn right into a priority road. What must you look out for?  
✅ Vehicles coming from the left and from the right  
❌ Only for vehicles coming from the left  
✅ For cyclists and pedestrians alongside you to the right or behind you  
**Comment**: Look not only to the left, but also to the right when turning into a priority road: An overtaking vehicle could be approaching quickly from there. In built-up areas, you must pay particular attention to 
pedestrians or cyclists, e.g. on your right or behind you.  
  
648. What must you do in case of a traffic jam in a tunnel?  
✅ Switch hazard warning lights on  
✅ When traffic comes to a standstill, keep a safety distance of approximately 5 m to the car ahead  
❌ Secure and leave vehicle immediately  
**Comment**: Traffic jams and tailbacks pose a risk of accidents. Switch on the hazard warning lights and keep a safe distance when driving slowly. When stationary, stop at a distance of approx. 5 m from the vehicle in 
front. Switch off the engine if you are stationary for a long time, stay in the vehicle, listen to the traffic radio and pay attention to loudspeaker announcements.  
  
649. You notice an accident in the tunnel. What do you have to do?  
❌ Do not leave your vehicle  
✅ Inform emergency services via the SOS-telephone  
✅ Switch on the hazard warning lights  
**Comment**: In the event of an accident in a tunnel, the priority is to secure the danger zone so that no further incidents occur. To do this, switch on the hazard warning lights immediately, park the vehicle as far away 
from the edge of the road as possible, set up the warning triangle and call for help on the emergency telephone. An emergency call by cell phone makes it more difficult to determine the location and delays help.  
  
650. A learner driver has committed several violations during the probationary period. The authority has ordered that the driver    
attends a supplementary driving course. The learner driver fails to comply with this order. What can they expect to happen?  
✅ The withdrawal of their driving licence  
❌ An order to attend a driver fitness session  
❌ An extension of the probationary period by another 3 years  
**Comment**: If a road user behaves in a way that raises doubts about their fitness to drive, their driving license can be withdrawn temporarily or permanently. Anyone who does not take part in the advanced training 
seminar despite being ordered to do so must expect their driving license to be revoked.  
  
651. You are involved in a traffic accident. What are you obliged to do?  
I have to  
✅ inform the other persons involved that I was also involved in the accident  
✅ provide my name and address upon demand to those entitled to this information  
✅ move promptly to the side of the roadway if damage is minor  
  
652. What is correct? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_36_005.jpg)  
❌ Turn without stopping  
✅ Wait at the crossroads  
**Comment**: If you see a police officer with his arms outstretched to the side in front or behind you at the intersection, you must wait in front of the intersection.  
  
653.  When may you take the turn?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_2_11_114_ende.jpg) A video question
✅ Only once the truck driver has used a hand signal to clearly indicate he is foregoing his right of way  
❌ Immediately, because the truck driver is prompting me to do that  
✅ Only if I do not endanger or significantly impede the cross traffic  
**Comment**: Do not take any risks: The light signals may mean that the truck driver is waiving his right of way and letting me go first. To be on the safe side, I wait for a clear hand signal before driving off carefully 
and without endangering others.    
  
654. What do you do when you see this traffic sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_001.jpg)  
❌ Observe the traffic coming from the right only  
✅ Reduce speed  
✅ Be ready to brake  
**Comment**: The sign indicates a junction or intersection with right of way from the right. For you, this means: reduce your speed, drive with increased attention and stay ready to brake so that you can give way if 
necessary.  
  
655. You see this traffic sign. What must you reckon with?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_005.jpg)  
❌ Oncoming traffic taking precedence  
✅ Dazzle from oncoming traffic at night  
✅ Oncoming traffic  
**Comment**:  The sign indicates that oncoming traffic on your own lane is to be expected, e.g. if a lane on the highway is temporarily open for both directions due to construction work. You must drive clearly to the 
right. At night, glare from oncoming traffic must be expected.  
  
656. What must you anticipate with this road sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_144.jpg)  
✅ With cyclists who may cross the carriageway  
❌ With a "cyclists prohibited" zone  
❌ With an underpass for cyclists  
**Comment**:  This danger sign warns of cyclists crossing the road. It is located at places where cyclists frequently or unexpectedly cross the road or enter it, e.g. because a cycle path ends.  
  
657. What do these traffic signs indicate?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_130.jpg)  
❌ Roadway with two lanes in one direction for 3 km  
❌ Start of a no-overtaking area 3 km ahead  
✅ No overtaking for 3 km  
**Comment**: Multi-lane vehicles (cars, trucks) and motorcycles with sidecars may not be overtaken. The no overtaking zone is 3 km long. Overtaking motorcycles without sidecars, mopeds, streetcars and non-motorized 
vehicles is permitted.  
  
658. What must you remember when you see this traffic sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_41_101.jpg)  
✅ Use snow-chains  
❌ Track-vehicles have priority  
✅ Maximum permissible speed 50 km/h  
**Comment**: This traffic sign is put up when a road can no longer be driven on normally due to large amounts of snow. You are not allowed to drive on this road without snow chains as you would break down and obstruct 
other traffic. You are only allowed to drive at a maximum speed of 50 km/h with snow chains.  
  
659. What does this traffic sign indicate?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_4_42_002.jpg)  
❌ The end of the autobahn  
❌ Motor vehicles prohibited  
✅ The end of the clearway for motor vehicles only  
  
660. What motor vehicles may enter an environment zone that has this sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_2_5_01_012.jpg)  
✅ Motorcycles  
❌ Motor vehicles that meet the requirements for a green particulate emissions sticker, even if no such sticker is attached  
✅ Motor vehicles with a green particulate emissions sticker   
**Comment**: Low emission zones serve to reduce harmful air pollution in urban areas. Only low-emission vehicles are allowed to drive here - as long as the corresponding sticker (in this case GREEN) is displayed correctly. 
Motorcycles do not have a sticker and are generally free to drive.  
  
661. Which prohibitions cease to apply when you see this sign? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_133.jpg)
✅ No overtaking  
✅ Speed restrictions  
❌ No parking  
**Comment**: All route prohibitions - speed limit, minimum speed, no overtaking - are lifted from this point onwards.  
  
662. What dangers can arise if this traffic sign is ignored?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_109.jpg)  
✅ The load could be damaged  
✅ The vehicle could suffer a broken axle or spring fracture  
✅ The vehicle could go into a skid and endanger oncoming traffic  
**Comment**: The sign warns of uneven road surfaces. If the speed is too high, the vehicle could skid and endanger oncoming traffic. In addition, cargo could be damaged or the vehicle could suffer axle and spring breakage. 
Therefore, adjust your speed.  
  
663. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_021_1.jpg)  
I may  
✅ only turn after the yellow bus  
✅ turn before the motorcycle  
❌ be the first to make my turn  
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The oncoming vehicle and I are on the priority road. The vehicle on the left must “give way”. However, as a left-turning driver, I must allow the oncoming vehicle 
to turn before I drive.
  
664. On which side must you overtake a tram which is travelling in the middle of the roadway (not a one-way street)?  ----IMP  
✅ On the right  
❌ On the left only if other vehicles are blocking the roadway on the right  
❌ On the left  
**Comment**: You may only overtake on the left. Exception: You must overtake a streetcar traveling in the middle of the road on the right. Only in one-way streets or where the tracks are too far to the right may you 
overtake the streetcar on the left.
  
665. An inspection has been performed because of a technical modification made to your vehicle. What are you obliged to do?  
I have to  
❌ stick the inspection report or confirmation into the designated place in the registration certificate Part II  
✅ carry the inspection report or confirmation in my vehicle, and have the registration in certificate Part I corrected if necessary  
❌ forward the inspection report or confirmation to the vehicle manufacturer  
**Comment**: If I have technically modified my vehicle and obtained a corresponding certificate, I must always carry the certificate or confirmation with me. If necessary, I must also have the modification entered in the 
registration certificate part I. 
  
666. What ends here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_41_136.jpg)  
❌ All previous zonal prohibitions  
❌ A no-stopping area  
✅ A no-waiting area  
  
667. What must you be prepared for here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_07_159.jpg)  
✅ People walking on the road  
✅ Vehicles turning onto the road  
✅ Oncoming vehicles turning left  
**Comment**: Note on a parking lot for hikers: With this traffic sign, not only pedestrians (e.g. from the parking lot towards the forest) are to be expected. Other vehicles from oncoming traffic could also approach the 
parking lot or drivers leaving the parking lot could turn onto my lane without paying attention.  
  
668. You are approaching a crossroads where the priority situation is not clear to you straightaway. What do you do?  
❌ Always proceed when driving straight ahead  
✅ Wait, observe and come to an agreement with others, if necessary  
❌ Proceed according to the rule "right before left"  
**Comment**:  Wait and watch the traffic if you do not immediately see the right-of-way situation. If necessary, communicate with other   
road users, e.g. using hand signals.  
  
669. What is the right thing to do?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_060.jpg)  
✅ The yellow car has to wait  
❌ I have to wait  
✅ I have to indicate  
**Comment**:  Even if it looks like a “real” traffic circle at first glance. The sign with the three circular arrows is missing  
here. Therefore, the usual right of way rules apply here! The blue arrow sign means: turn right. In contrast to the traffic sign  
for traffic circles, I have to indicate when entering and leaving the traffic circle. The traffic in the circle does NOT have  
right of way here. For them, the rule is: RIGHT BEFORE LEFT, so they have to wait and let me go first.  
  
670. You have taken the right lane by mistake although you want to turn left. How are you allowed to proceed?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_37_102.jpg)  
✅ Straight ahead  
✅ To the right  
❌ To the left when the traffic lights are "green"  
**Comment**: Arrows on the road indicate the direction of travel at the next junction. They recommend that you get into the lane early. As long as the lines are broken, you may change lanes. If the lines are solid, you 
must follow the direction of travel indicated by the arrows. This means that in the situation shown you may only drive straight ahead or turn right.  
  
671. You want to continue driving straight ahead. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_11_103.jpg)  
✅ I move to the right if there is sufficient space in the traffic  
✅ I remain waiting in my lane  
❌ I overtake the vehicle alongside me and switch lanes  
**Comment**: The waiting left-turner is blocking the straight ahead lane. However, swerving into the right-hand lane is only possible if there is a sufficiently large gap in traffic. Until then, I must stay in the lane, 
watch the traffic and stop if necessary. Only change lanes if it is safe to do so!  
  
672. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_120.jpg)  
✅ I have to allow the blue vehicle to pass  
❌ I have to allow the green vehicle to pass through  
✅ I may make the turn before the green vehicle  
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. The vehicle on the right and I are driving on the priority road with the right turn. The vehicle on the right follows the course of the priority road. I have to 
let it pass first because I want to leave the priority road. The vehicle on the side road must “give way” to all others.  
  
673. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_048.jpg)  
❌ I am the first to proceed  
❌ I allow the motorcycle to turn before me  
✅ I allow the blue car to turn  
**Comment**: At junctions without priority traffic signs or traffic lights, the vehicle coming from the right has right of way. Here I have to let the vehicle coming from the right go first. Then I drive. Oncoming traffic 
turning left must wait until everything is clear.  
  
674. What must you heed in this situation? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_02_108.jpg)  
(Hazard warning lights on)  
You may  
✅ pass at walking speed only  
❌ not pass under any circumstances  
✅ pass only if you are sure that passengers are not endangered  
**Comment**: Vehicles may only pass a bus with hazard warning lights flashing at the bus stop at a maximum of walking speed. This applies both to vehicles traveling in the same direction as the bus and to vehicles coming 
in the opposite direction. They must not endanger passengers.  
  
675. What measures help protect the environment? ----IMP  
Using  
✅ low-resistance tyres  
✅ low viscosity engine oil  
❌ air-conditioning systems  
**Comment**: Air conditioning systems consume additional energy. Low-friction oils reduce friction in the engine and low-friction tires reduce friction on the road. This saves energy and avoids noise.  
  
676. You have purchased a 3-year-old car for your own personal use. The vehicle roadworthiness test certificate is new. What is the time   
limit until the next roadworthiness test must be performed?   
Answer: The time limit is ___24___ months  
**Comment**:  The first main inspection of a new vehicle is due after three years. After that, cars must be inspected every two years (=24 months).  
  
677. What is the right course of action?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_018_1.jpg)  
❌ I have to allow the truck to pass through  
✅ I have to allow the yellow van to pass through  
✅ I take priority before the truck  
**Comment**:  Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. My opponent and I must “give way” and allow vehicles on the priority road to pass first. I then drive in front of the oncoming left-turner, as I continue straight 
ahead.  
  
678. What must you be aware of here?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_12_123.jpg)  
✅ It is not permitted to stop to the left of the boundary line of the carriageway  
✅ Slower moving vehicles must use the hard shoulder if possible  
❌ Driving across the boundary line of the carriageway is prohibited at all times  
**Comment**: The hard shoulder separated from the road by a solid line (lane boundary) on the right is reserved for stopping or slow-moving vehicles, e.g. tractors or mopeds. Vehicles may not stop to the left of the lane 
boundary.  
  
679. As the vehicle owner, what change must you report to the relevant licensing authority?  
A change to  
✅ my home address  
❌ my third-party insurance   
✅ my name  
**Comment**: The registration office needs to know who owns which vehicle. So if I change my name (e.g. due to marriage) or address (due to moving house), I must report this so that the authority is kept up to date.  
  
680. What is the right course of action here? ----IMP  
✅ The blue car may proceed ahead of the yellow car  
❌ I may proceed ahead of the yellow car  
❌ I may proceed ahead of the blue car  
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way here. This is a turning right of way. I have to give way and wait until all vehicles on the right of way have passed.  The vehicle on the left drives first, then the 
oncoming vehicle may turn, I drive last. 
  
681. Are you allowed to park here? https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_110.jpg (Sign 314 + Sign 1044-10)  
✅ Yes, as a seriously disabled person with an official parking permit  
✅ Yes, as a person accompanying blind persons with an official parking permit  
❌ Yes, briefly for shopping  
**Comment**: The additional sign “Severely disabled persons with exceptional walking disabilities and blind persons” permits parking only with an official parking permit, e.g. for severely disabled persons and persons 
accompanying blind persons. 
  
682. What must you be aware of here? (A signal with roundabout and Give way )  
I have to  
✅ give the car right of way  
✅ continue to brake  
❌ indicate when entering the roundabout  
**Comment**: If the junction to a traffic circle is marked in this way (with the red “Give way” and the blue “Roundabout”), traffic on the roundabout lane has right of way. To give others right of way, it makes sense to 
approach the traffic circle  slowly, so I slow down in good time. I only indicate when exiting to show others where I am leaving the traffic circle. Tip: Watch the movie again at your leisure and pay attention to the 
traffic signs!  
  
683. When may you use the right-hand hard shoulder?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_02_101.jpg)  
✅ For stopping and parking  
✅ For driving a slow-moving vehicle  
❌ For overtaking  
**Comment**: The right-hand hard shoulder may be used for stopping and parking. You may also drive on it with slow vehicles.  
  
684. What is the right course of action? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_1_07_174_ende.jpg)  
✅ I remain waiting in my lane for now  
✅ I continue braking  
❌ I steer to the left now  
**Comment**: Hazard lights, roadworks, turning maneuvers: I slow down and stay in my lane for the time being, allow the truck to reverse and complete its maneuver. If necessary, I stop. Spontaneously steering to the left 
would be dangerous! Only when everything is clear beside and behind me can I change lanes and drive past the obstacle. TIP: Watch the movie several times and pay attention to the movements of others (also in the rear-view 
mirrors)!  
  
685. The vehicles ahead of you are driving at about 30 km/h. Why are you not permitted to overtake before the road bend? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_06_035.jpg)  
✅ Because my overtaking distance is too long  
✅ Because the red car might pull out to overtake  
❌ Because I am not permitted to cross the lane marking  
**Comment**: The red and white arrow sign in front indicates a sharp, confusing left turn. For me, the overtaking distance would be too long to be able to cut back in time before the curve. I also have to take  
into account that the person in front of me could pull out to overtake myself. I can drive over the guideline - here, but the overall risk of an overtaking maneuver before the curve is too great. (*I may drive over  
interrupted guidelines, but I may not drive over lines without interruptions.)  
  
686. Why might taking the right turn be dangerous here? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_03_116.jpg)  
✅ Because vehicles emerging from the side street could start to skid  
✅ Because I might possibly not be able to stop in time, if pedestrians are crossing the side street  
✅ Because my vehicle might start to skid if I take the turn too fast  
**Comment**: In these road conditions, there is a risk of skidding if you turn right too quickly or if vehicles coming from the side road have to brake. In addition, you would hardly be able to stop in time for pedestrians 
in the slush.  
  
687. Why do you have to pay particular attention here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_03_114.jpg)  
✅ Because the road surface is uneven  
✅ Because it is not clear which direction the road will take  
✅ Because oncoming traffic could cut the corner  
**Comment**:  You should drive carefully here, as the road surface has been repaired and has an unfavorable effect on cornering. The course of the road is unclear, someone may have broken down behind the bend, for example, 
or a vehicle may be coming towards you that is cutting the bend.  
  
688. What do you have to be aware of in this situation? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_6_06_216.jpg)  
✅ In 200 m the width of the left-hand lane is going to narrow  
✅ Including its exterior mirrors, my vehicle is wider than the width specified in the vehicle documents  
❌ The left-hand lane is going to narrow for a distance of 200 m  
**Comment**: The sign indicates a lane narrowing after 200 m. The left-hand lane narrows to 2 m actual width. The vehicle width is stated in the vehicle documents without wing mirrors. My vehicle can therefore be wider 
than 2 m. If in doubt, I change to the right-hand lane in good time.  
  
689. What must you anticipate in this situation? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_2_1_02_005_1.jpg)  
✅ Children walking out onto the road  
✅ People exiting their vehicles via the side nearest the road  
❌ There is a pedestrian crossing up ahead  
**Comment**: I have to drive slowly here because the course of the road is unclear due to the parked vehicles. The traffic sign also warns that children could run onto the road between the parked vehicles at any time. In 
addition, a door on one of the cars could open onto the road. Crosswalks are announced with another traffic sign.  
  
690. You are the new owner of a licensed vehicle. What do you have to do?  
I have to  
❌ generally arrange for a vehicle roadworthiness test to be performed at the time of the change of ownership  
✅ notify the licensing authority of the change in ownership  
✅ present the licensing authority with proof of the existence of liability insurance for the vehicle  
**Comment**:  The registration office must know who owns a vehicle and who is liable in the event of damage: When I purchase a vehicle, I must have it registered immediately and submit proof of insurance to the 
registration office. 
  
691. After turning left, you want to turn immediately right. How should you position your vehicle?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_09_104.jpg)  
Like  
❌ the green car  
❌ the blue car  
✅ the red car  
**Comment**: All drivers turning left must get into the lane in good time and avoid endangering the traffic behind them. Anyone who wants to turn right again immediately after turning left must - like the red car - get 
into the right-hand lane if there are two left-turn lanes.  
  
692. You want to turn right at the junction. What is the right thing to do? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_07_019_1.jpg)  
✅ I change lanes as early as possible  
✅ I may not impede cyclists in the cycle lane  
❌ I may only cross over the cycle lane at walking speed  
**Comment**:  A protective lane for cycle traffic, here as a cycle path between two lanes: If I want to turn right at the next junction, I have to use a double gap. That's why it's best to change lanes as early as  
possible, so I have a reserve. I drive at the permitted speed so that I don't obstruct cyclists or other vehicles when I change lanes. If I had to slow down to walking speed, it would be far too dangerous for the cyclist 
behind me (rear-view mirror), for example! 
  
693. What is the correct course of action in this situation? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_2_07_105_ende.jpg)  
✅ I move over to the right-hand lane after around 200 m  
✅ I may overtake the vehicles driving in the right-hand lane  
❌ I move into the right-hand lane now  
**Comment**: Roadworks and lane narrowing in about 200 m. A basic rule of the zipper procedure is: only change lanes immediately before the narrowing begins, i.e. do not follow the bad example of the vehicle in front. 
Initially, everyone drives in their own lane, i.e. I may overtake the vehicles on the right if necessary (observe the speed limit!). Shortly before the bottleneck, the vehicles in both lanes should take turns: Ideally, 
after a vehicle driving in the through lane, the next one should let me thread in carefully from the left!   
  
694. You are on a road outside of a built-up area, and a car in front of you is driving much slower than is permitted to and has the  
capacity to.
What is the right course of action?  
✅ I adjust my speed to that of the car  
✅ I overtake at a suitable place  
❌ I flash my headlights, until the car begins to drive faster  
**Comment**:  If someone is driving very slowly in front of me, excitement doesn't help. Perhaps he has a good reason for it. The best thing to do is to match your own speed to the vehicle in front. Keep a safe distance 
and only overtake when there is an opportunity to overtake safely.  
  
695. Where may you park here? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_12_128_1.jpg)  
In my direction of travel  
❌ on the left-hand hard shoulder only  
❌ on the right-hand hard shoulder only  
✅ on the left and right-hand hard shoulders  
**Comment**:  Parking is permitted on both sides of roads with only one direction of travel (one-way streets), in this case on the left and right-hand hard shoulder.  
  
696. Why might driving along this road become dangerous? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_04_108.jpg)  
❌Because oncoming vehicles will only be detected very late  
✅ Because persons on the road can be easily overlooked  
✅ Because poorly lit vehicles can be difficult to detect  
**Comment**:  The poor illumination can easily lead to pedestrians crossing the road in dark areas being overlooked. Poorly lit vehicles are also difficult to see in such areas.  
  
697. What must you anticipate when you see this road sign?![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_40_010.jpg)  
✅ Pedestrians that might cross the road  
✅ A pedestrian crossing that is hard to see  
❌ Pedestrians who may only cross the road from the right  
**Comment**:  The danger sign with this symbol warns of particular dangers posed by pedestrians. It indicates a crosswalk. I drive carefully here and watch out for vehicles in front: If necessary, I reduce my speed!  
  
698. What is the right course of action now? Video Question ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_2_37_018_ende.jpg) .   
❌ I drive through the junction quickly, because "yellow" is displayed    
✅ I allow any cross traffic the right of way    
❌ wait at the stop line for the next set of green lights    
**Comment**: If a traffic light shows a yellow flashing light, I must approach with increased caution and cross the intersection in compliance with the traffic signs. This means that you may have to give way to cross 
traffic and give priority to pedestrians, for example.  
  
699. You want to park your single-axle trailer (overrun brakes, 1000 kg permissible total mass) on a slope. What must you do?    
❌ Engage the reverse lock    
✅ Pull the parking brake    
✅ Place wheel chocks under the wheels    
**Comment**: To prevent a parked trailer from rolling away on a slope, it must always be secured before uncoupling. To do this, apply the parking brake and place wheel chocks in front of the wheels.    
  
700. What should you do? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_2_37_013_ende.jpg) .   
❌ Slow down  
✅ Continue driving    
**Comment**: You drive at 40 to 50 km/h and the traffic light changes to yellow. If there are only about 10 m to the traffic light, as in this case, it is too close to brake: drive on.  
  
701. You are driving a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox. What style of driving results in higher fuel consumption within a built-up area?  
✅ Driving at high engine speed    
✅ Accelerating heavily    
❌ Driving in a high gear    
**Comment**: High fuel consumption is caused by a number of factors. Unnecessarily heavy acceleration & braking instead of a smooth and steady driving style are just as much a part of it as driving at high engine speeds.  
  
702. You have taken the right lane by mistake although you want to turn left. How are you allowed to proceed?   
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_2_37_102.jpg)  
✅ Straight ahead    
✅ To the right    
❌ To the left when the traffic lights are "green"    
**Comment**: Arrows on the road indicate the direction of travel at the next junction. You are advised to get into the correct lane in good time. As long as the lines are broken, you may change lanes. If the lines are 
solid, you must follow the direction indicated by the arrows. This means that in the situation shown you may only drive straight ahead or turn right.  
  
703. Who is responsible for the roadworthiness of a licensed vehicle?    
❌ The motor liability insurance company    
✅ The owner   
✅ The driver    
**Comment**:  Drivers and owners are responsible for the operational and road safety of a vehicle. This includes, for example, checking the brakes, tires, steering and lights.  
  
704. You are the new owner of a licensed vehicle. What do you have to do?    
I have to    
❌ generally arrange for a vehicle roadworthiness test to be performed at the time of the change of ownership    
✅ present the licensing authority with proof of the existence of liability insurance for the vehicle    
✅ notify the licensing authority of the change in ownership    
**Comment**:  The registration office must know who owns a vehicle and who is liable in the event of damage: When I purchase a vehicle, I must have it registered immediately and submit proof of insurance to the 
registration office.  
  
705. What must you do upon seeing this traffic sign? ![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_4_42_138.jpg)    
✅ I may not remain stationary on the pedestrian crossing if the traffic backs up    
✅ I must approach at a moderate speed if it is clear that pedestrians want to cross the road    
✅ I must allow the pedestrians to cross the road    
  
706. Where is parking prohibited?  
✅ On priority roads outside built-up areas  
❌ On priority roads within built-up areas  
✅ At the edge of the roadway if this would prevent others from using designated parking areas  
**Comment**: Anyone who leaves their vehicle or stops for longer than 3 minutes is parking. Parking is not permitted everywhere. For example, it is forbidden to park on the edge of the road if this prevents the use of 
marked parking spaces. It is also prohibited on the carriageway of priority roads outside built-up areas.  
  
707. Why are you not allowed to overtake here?  
✅ Because the side clearance to the cyclists is too small  
❌ Because I may not cross the centre line  
✅ Because I may endanger oncoming traffic  
**Comment**: I am not allowed to overtake before this left-hand bend for two reasons: 1. the side distance to the cyclists would be too small and 2. I cannot rule out the possibility of endangering oncoming traffic. The 
guideline does not play a role here, apart from that only uninterrupted guidelines may not be crossed.  
  
708. In bends with poor road conditions, what increases the risk of skidding?  
✅ Having a damaged chassis  
✅ Having the wrong tyre inflation pressure  
✅ Having a wrongly loaded cargo  
**Comment**:  If the traction (the interlocking between the tire and the road) is lost, there is a risk of skidding. Especially on roads in poor condition. A defective chassis, incorrect tire pressure and incorrect loading 
significantly increase the risk of skidding.  
  
709. What can result in your motor vehicle skidding while driving round a bend?  
✅ Heavy oversteer  
❌ Gently accelerating at the exit of the bend  
✅ Driving too fast  
**Comment**: Centrifugal force is at work when cornering. It “pulls” the car to the outside of the bend, i.e. to the right in a left-hand bend. Therefore, reduce speed beforehand. The faster I drive, the less grip I have. 
There is a particular risk of skidding in bends due to strong steering input.  
  
710. One of your wheels has collided heavily against a kerb. What should you note?  
✅ The handling of the vehicle could be negatively affected  
✅ The tyre could have a slow puncture  
✅ The vehicle should be checked in a garage  
**Comment**: If I drive hard into an obstacle with a tire, e.g. a kerb, it may be damaged without any obvious defect. The tire can gradually lose air or the handling of the vehicle can change negatively. An inspection in 
the workshop provides peace of mind.  
  
711. What is the right course of action?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_021_1.jpg)  
I may  
✅ turn before the motorcycle  
❌ be the first to make my turn  
✅ only turn after the yellow bus  
**Comment**: Traffic signs regulate the right of way. The oncoming vehicle and I are on the priority road. The vehicle on the left must “give way”. However, as a left-turning driver, I must allow the oncoming vehicle to 
turn before I drive. 
  
712. What should you do now? (Muggup)  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_1_08_016_ende.jpg)  
✅ I slow my vehicle down  
❌ I continue driving in the clear lane  
✅ I switch on my hazard lights  
**Comment**: Speed limit ends, finally free travel on the highway. But watch out: hazard warning lights in front of me - the end of a traffic jam! I brake and switch on the hazard warning lights to warn those behind me.  
  
713. What is required when your vehicle is no longer covered by motor liability insurance?  
The vehicle  
✅ may no longer be used in road traffic  
❌ must be submitted to the registration centre  
✅ must be de-registered at the registration centre  
**Comment**: Third-party liability insurance must be taken out for every motor vehicle. If you cause an accident, it ensures that the other party's damages are paid. If the liability insurance has lapsed, you are not 
allowed to drive the vehicle on public roads. The vehicle must be deregistered at the registration office.  

714. A light signal with no level crossing sign is positioned before a level crossing, and in front of a junction with a road to the   
right. The red light is illuminated. Where must you wait?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/VZ_1_2_19_110.jpg)  
✅ At the stop line  
✅ In front of the light signal, if there is no stop line  
❌ I can drive up to the level crossing after watching out for other traffic  
**Comment**: If there is a red light signal without a St. Andrew's cross in front of a level crossing on a road leading in from the right, you must wait at the stop line. If there is no stop line, you must wait in front of 
the light.  

715. What is the right course of action here?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_3_01_047.jpg)  
I have to  
✅ allow the blue car to pass through  
✅ stop on the stop line  
❌ allow the red car to pass through  
**Comment**: The STOP sign is clear: I must stop at the stop line and give way to traffic on the turning priority road. This does not include the road on the left. The rule “right before left” applies to traffic coming 
from the left - and I am coming from the right. So I may drive after the vehicle on the priority road, but in front of the vehicle coming from the left.  

716. What can be the effect of an overload of only 20%?  
✅ Steering may become worse  
✅ The brakes may be overstrained  
✅ There may be too much strain on the load-bearing parts of the vehicle  
**Comment**: Make sure that your vehicle is not overloaded when you are transporting something. Even a 20% overload puts excessive strain on the brakes, which leads to a deterioration in braking behavior. Steering behavior 
also deteriorates noticeably. Overloading can also lead to damage to load-bearing vehicle parts.  

717. Which statements are correct in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_1_02_110.jpg)
(Hazard warning lights on)  
✅ The bus may be passed in either lane but no faster than at walking speed  
❌ The vehicles in the left lane may pass the bus without paying any special attention  
✅ Vehicles in both lanes must stop if passengers would otherwise be endangered  
**Comment**: You may only drive past stopping buses with their hazard warning lights switched on at walking speed. If two lanes run past the bus stop in the same direction, the walking speed applies to both lanes. If 
necessary, stop if passengers would otherwise be endangered.  

718. What should you do?
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_2_07_007_ende.jpg)  
❌ I move into the left-hand lane and overtake the red car in front of me  
✅ I stay in the middle lane and slow down  
❌ I move to the right-hand lane and slow down
**Comment**: After the announced lane narrowing, I expect a speed limit. If the bottleneck is not far away, it is no longer worth changing to the left-hand lane.I stay in “my” lane and reduce my speed.  
TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to traffic signs (announced lane narrowing)!  

719. You want to overtake. What is the right thing to do?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/AB_1_4_41_167.jpg)   
I may  
✅ overtake  
❌ not overtake  
❌ only overtake, if I remain in the right-hand lane while doing so  
**Comment**: A continuous line must not be crossed. However, if there is a broken line next to the continuous line, this is a one-sided lane restriction. Both lines may be crossed from the side of the broken line.
Therefore, I am allowed to cross both lines and overtake the cyclist if I am not endangering anyone.

720. What is the right thing to do in this situation? - Video Question  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_2_2_05_011_ende.jpg)   
✅ I cease the overtaking manoeuvre and move into the right-hand lane  
❌ I accelerate and continue the overtaking manoeuvre  
❌ continue the overtaking manoeuvre at an unchanged speed  
**Comment**: In this case, I have to stop overtaking and move into the right-hand lane because the cyclist I have caught up with is accelerating unexpectedly - and I am keeping to the prescribed speed limit - even if
the sign is not visible: I've  just passed it! TIP: Watch the movie again and pay attention to traffic signs (speed limit)!  

721. What is the rule created by the road markings in this situation?  
![img](https://schueler.click-learn.info/BilderV2/BS_1_4_42_010_1_ende.jpg)   
I have to  
❌ come to a stop in front of the road markings  
❌ give way to the green truck  
✅ approach the junction cautiously  
**Comment**: The white marking on the road is called “shark's teeth” because of its appearance. It emphasizes an existing obligation to wait, in this case due to a right-before-left rule (intersection without right-of-way
traffic signs). Therefore: Approach carefully, get an overview and behave according to the rules (I may drive here first, the driver on the left must wait).

722. 721. How can you tell whether the rear fog lamp is switched on?  
✅ By the amber indicator light  
❌ By the red indicator light  
❌ By the blue indicator light  
**Comment**: The rear fog light may only be switched on when visibility is less than 50m. If it is switched on, a yellow indicator light comes on.
